//! Per-tool-round loop checkpoints for crash-tolerant runs (P3 cut 1).
//!
//! The agent loop persists a [`LoopCheckpoint`] after each completed tool
//! round. The checkpoint captures the minimum state needed to recreate
//! the loop's position so a future process — typically on a different
//! node, dispatched by 书安OS after a crash or planned migration — can
//! resume from the last consistent boundary.
//!
//! Boundary policy: checkpoints are taken **only** between tool rounds,
//! never mid-tool. If a process dies while a tool is executing, the
//! work of that round is lost on resume; the LLM re-deliberates from
//! the previous checkpoint. This trades retry cost for correctness —
//! re-executing a non-idempotent tool (write, bash) on the wrong side
//! of the boundary is worse than re-asking the LLM.
//!
//! Resume API (cut 2 follow-up): not part of this cut. This module
//! lands the data contract + persistence wiring; an
//! `AgentSession::resume_run(run_id)` entry point will live on top.
