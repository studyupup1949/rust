//! Budget / cost / quota contract for cluster-grade hosts.
//!
//! The framework does not enforce budgets itself — it only defines the
//! decision points and emits structured events. The host
//! implements [`BudgetGuard`] with whatever backend it likes
//! (per-tenant counters in Redis, per-day USD caps in Postgres, etc.)
//! and plugs it into [`SessionOptions::with_budget_guard`](crate::SessionOptions::with_budget_guard).
//!
//! Decision points wired today:
//!
//! 1. **Before each LLM call** — [`BudgetGuard::check_before_llm`].
//!    A `Deny` aborts the call; a `SoftLimit` lets the call proceed but
//!    triggers an [`AgentEvent::BudgetThresholdHit`](crate::AgentEvent::BudgetThresholdHit) so in-session
//!    policy (hooks, custom prompts) can react.
//! 2. **After each LLM call** — [`BudgetGuard::record_after_llm`].
//!    The host updates its running spend total with the actual usage.
//! 3. **Before each tool call** — [`BudgetGuard::check_before_tool`].
//!    Same decision shape; useful for capping expensive tools per
//!    tenant.
//!
//! The default trait methods are no-ops returning [`BudgetDecision::Allow`]
//! so existing code is unaffected until a host plugs in a real impl.
//!
//! See [`AgentEvent::BudgetThresholdHit`](crate::agent::AgentEvent::BudgetThresholdHit)
//! for the event vocabulary triggered by `SoftLimit`.
