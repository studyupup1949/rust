# Changelog

All notable changes to A3S DeepResearch are documented in this file.

The project follows Semantic Versioning while the public API remains in the
`0.x` development series.

## [Unreleased]

## [0.1.3] - 2026-07-26

### Added

- Add `DeepResearchRequest`, `EvidenceScope`, `WorkspaceSourceHint`,
  `DeepResearchResult`, `PublicationOutcome`, and `DeepResearchEvent` as the
  typed product-integration contract.
- Add runtime-agnostic cooperative cancellation and terminal cancelled/failed
  lifecycle events.
- Add run-scoped report materializers under
  `.a3s/research/artifacts/<run-id>/` with exact receipt recovery.
- Add request-owned output-language inference and override, strict
  `report_language` schemas, aggregate prose-language admission, and localized
  Chinese source-backed/no-evidence publication.
- Add persisted analytical-claim and cross-source-synthesis quality metrics in
  version-3 publication receipts, bind version-4 receipts to the request-owned
  output language, and persist resolved/deeply-analyzed material-dimension
  counts in version-5 receipts.
- Promote at most three explicit HTTP(S) references from the user query to
  direct retrieval seeds, with fragment removal, credential rejection,
  deduplication, and a network-free `local_only` contract.

### Changed

- Route explicit workspace source hints through exact Host reads and the normal
  provenance boundary, while keeping the raw `execute(Value)` API available for
  legacy adapters.
- Reserve query-slug artifacts for read-only compatibility so concurrent
  same-query runs can publish without overwriting each other.
- Normalize typed result diagnostics to the four publication outcomes and
  artifact kinds without duplicating filesystem paths in the JSON output.
- Replace the plain report link row with a sticky left action menu, a centered
  report surface, and a sticky right table of contents. Narrow screens stack
  both navigation regions ahead of the report without horizontal overflow.
- Require every resolved material dimension in a comprehensive typed report to
  contain a direct answer, two factual findings supported across two sources,
  two inferences, three analytical claims, one cross-source synthesis, and 800
  substantive characters, with a 1,200-character report-wide floor. The prompt
  separates source comparison, mechanism or trade-off, implication, and
  applicability boundary instead of accepting one catch-all synthesis
  paragraph.
- Add an evidence-preserving narrative plan that can choose natural section
  headings and group adjacent claim IDs into paragraphs but cannot add,
  paraphrase, reorder, or omit admitted findings.
- Render the authored argument as continuous prose without fixed
  evidence/analysis/recommendation subheadings, and move basis edges and
  derivations into a collapsed traceability disclosure.
- Reject repeated claim openings and near-duplicate claim prose so length and
  claim-count gates cannot be satisfied with editorial padding.
- Render typed, source-backed, qualified, and degraded HTML through one fixed
  A3S Code Web-aligned visual system. Legacy presentation metadata remains
  readable for compatibility but no longer changes report styling or layout.
- Allow source-native supplemental retrieval queries when they improve recall
  while keeping planner prose and final publication pinned to the user's output
  language.
- Plan a central shared evidence track for comprehensive named comparisons,
  allow distinct atomic criteria to reuse the same question role, and validate
  the required comprehensive role mix once across the complete plan.
- Allow an all-bounded comprehensive report to publish as `Qualified` only when
  exactly one bounded dimension contains the full two-source analytical chain,
  at least 1,200 substantive characters, exactly one partial conclusion, and an
  explicit typed gap. Shallow inventories and one-step comparisons still fail
  closed to the source-backed artifact.

## [0.1.2] - 2026-07-24

### Added

- Replay the complete frozen F01-F08 corpus through
  `DeepResearchEngine::execute`, including typed single-target extraction
  failure and report-generation timeout injection.
- Make `deep_research_typed_claim_graph` the active report-generation protocol.
  It carries fact, inference, and recommendation claims; exact source/chunk
  support; basis edges; reproducible derivations; contradiction relations; and
  typed dimension gaps through the production engine.
- Add the `Qualified` publication outcome for useful admitted claims with a
  remaining material gap, including publication receipts and product-adapter
  recovery.

### Changed

- Allow a focused report to publish one structurally sufficient cited claim
  instead of requiring an unrelated extra finding.
- Persist accepted relation, derivation, basis-edge, and gap counts through the
  engine quality envelope, version-2 publication receipt, and product journal.
  Version-1 receipts remain readable, but cannot manufacture a qualified
  outcome without an explicit typed gap.
- The active F01-F08 replay now produces synthesized reports for F01, F02, F04,
  F05, F07, and F08; a qualified report for F03; and the intended source-backed
  timeout result for F06.

### Fixed

- Resolve an ambiguous publication-port failure from the exact run-scoped
  receipt when the report pair and receipt were already committed. A valid
  workflow publication and receipt must agree exactly; invalid result prose
  cannot discard a committed publication.
- Preserve the staged source-backed report when final synthesized publication
  fails. The engine re-publishes the closed source snapshot so the report pair,
  publication status, quality metrics, and durable receipt cannot describe
  different artifact generations.
- Align the executable discovery smoke fixture with the exact current batch
  envelope and verify that unstructured search output fails closed.
- Verify every frozen-corpus source path and SHA-256 digest so evaluation
  snapshots cannot drift while the replay suite remains green.
- Remove the TUI adapter's duplicate nonzero-finding requirement so a valid
  focused direct-answer claim reaches terminal settlement unchanged.
- Isolate malformed bootstrap and planned retrieval envelopes by their closed
  stage and packet-version contracts. A valid planned sibling still reaches
  synthesis, while raw bootstrap bytes remain audit-only and cannot be
  promoted into evidence after planned-envelope failure.

## [0.1.1] - 2026-07-23

### Changed

- Treat raw web and workspace acquisition as audit-only; only the Host-projected
  inquiry collection can grant semantic source admission.
- Preserve structurally valid source query parameters without parameter-name
  allowlists or provider-specific URL rewriting.
- Require reader-facing compiler labels and boundary prose in the closed
  research contract instead of selecting templates from a language code.
- Identify degraded artifact classes with explicit versioned markers rather
  than matching English or Chinese report sentences.

### Fixed

- Remove stale calls to the deleted `lowValueUrl` classifier that caused web
  discovery to fail at runtime while still passing JavaScript syntax checks.
- Add an executable discovery-workflow smoke test for structured search output
  and fail-closed unstructured output.
- Remove publisher/domain authority inference, fetched-text noise vocabulary,
  language/script branching, token-overlap deduplication, and topic-specific
  source transformations from production admission paths.

## [0.1.0] - 2026-07-23

### Added

- Standalone, port-based DeepResearch orchestration for A3S products.
- Exact-query bootstrap retrieval with bounded semantic planning and one
  typed-coverage supplemental pass.
- Progressive source-backed, synthesized, and no-evidence publication modes.
- Closed report proposals with host-owned citations and research-track IDs.
- Typed source coverage for completion criteria, primary sources, and
  independent corroboration.
- Domain-neutral frozen replay fixtures and publication-quality gates.

### Changed

- Web discovery fallback remains audit-only unless a closed semantic evidence
  pass admits the source.
- Comprehensive reports must cover every material research track and all
  declared completion criteria.
- Report findings are grouped by the planner's semantic research tracks.

### Fixed

- Preserve final inquiry-selection provenance instead of falling back to stale
  bootstrap acquisition metadata.
- Decode the durable string-array source-role format emitted by the retrieval
  workflow so real coverage edges reach report admission.
- Prevent one source from satisfying both primary-source and independent-source
  requirements without a distinct corroborating source.
- Remove publisher allowlists, domain-name authority inference, query-token
  overlap admission, and topic-specific source routing.
