## Overview

**A3S DeepResearch** is the standalone research engine used by A3S products.
It owns reusable planning, retrieval orchestration, evidence admission, report
quality gates, and Markdown/HTML publication without depending on the A3S CLI,
TUI, or web application.

DeepResearch is domain-agnostic. It does not route research by topic,
named-entity dictionaries, query keywords, language, publisher, domain, URL
shape, or error prose. Semantic model calls make bounded content judgments;
deterministic code validates closed schemas, exact identities, budgets,
provenance edges, artifact hashes, and durable state.

### Basic usage

The host supplies four asynchronous ports and runs the same engine from any
product surface:

```rust,no_run
use a3s_deep_research::{
    engine::{
        DeepResearchCancellation, DeepResearchEngine, DeepResearchRequest,
        EngineLimits, EvidenceScope, ProgressPort, PublicationPort,
        StructuredGenerationPort, WorkflowExecutionPort, WorkspaceSourceHint,
    },
};

async fn research(
    generation: &dyn StructuredGenerationPort,
    workflow: &dyn WorkflowExecutionPort,
    publication: &dyn PublicationPort,
    progress: &dyn ProgressPort,
    query: &str,
    current_date: &str,
) -> Result<(), Box<dyn std::error::Error>> {
    let request = DeepResearchRequest::new(
        "product-run-id",
        query,
        EvidenceScope::WebAndWorkspace,
    )
    .with_current_date(current_date)
    .with_workspace_source_hints(vec![
        WorkspaceSourceHint::new("docs/product-context.md"),
    ]);
    let cancellation = DeepResearchCancellation::new();

    let result = DeepResearchEngine::new(generation, workflow, publication, progress)
        .with_limits(EngineLimits::default())
        .execute_request(request, cancellation)
        .await?;

    println!("{}", result.artifacts.html.display());
    Ok(())
}
```

`DeepResearchResult` keeps the completed lifecycle separate from the terminal
`PublicationOutcome`, and returns typed quality metrics plus exact artifact
paths. `execute(Value)` and `DeepResearchRun` remain available as a legacy
adapter while products migrate away from constructing or parsing engine JSON.
The typed result's diagnostic `output` uses the same four publication names and
exposes only `artifact_kinds`; exact filesystem paths remain confined to the
typed `artifacts` field.

`DeepResearchRequest::new` infers the reader language from the query. A product
with an explicit locale selection may replace it with
`with_output_language("zh")` or another validated BCP 47 tag.

## Features

- **Exact-Query Bootstrap**: Start retrieval from the unmodified user query
  while semantic planning runs concurrently, and promote at most three explicit
  HTTP(S) references in that query to direct retrieval seeds
- **Bounded Semantic Planning**: Decompose at most 24 atomic user requirements,
  map every requirement to one or more of at most eight material research
  tracks, and add at most 15 supplemental plain-text queries without replacing
  the original query; unmatched, duplicate, or invented mappings fail closed
- **Closed Evidence Admission**: Admit only exact source and chunk identities
  selected through typed track, criterion, and source-role edges
- **Global Source Attribution**: Review each changed reduced source portfolio
  as one closed packet when declared independence otherwise appears complete,
  reuse the result while that portfolio is unchanged, and preserve or refresh
  it for the final portfolio. Collapse mirrors, syndication, translations, and
  other derivative records into accountable-origin groups, and count
  independence only for positively established group pairs; an unavailable or
  malformed attribution pass preserves the sources but cannot satisfy
  independent depth
- **Typed Claim Graphs**: Distinguish facts, inferences, and recommendations,
  with explicit citations, basis edges, derivations, contradictions, and gaps
- **Reader-Language Pinning**: Infer or accept one BCP 47 output language and
  bind planning, report schema, admission, and publication to that exact value
- **Per-Dimension Depth Gate**: Require every resolved material dimension in a
  comprehensive report to contain a direct answer, two factual findings from
  positively independent attribution groups, a comparison and explanation
  that converge through the typed basis graph into an implication, and an
  explicit challenge or applicability boundary. Depth counts only Unicode
  letters and numbers in admitted claim prose, so punctuation, layout,
  citations, and headings cannot pad the threshold. Only complete material
  coverage can become a successful
  `Synthesized` result; any `Qualified` graph remains an explicitly incomplete
  preview
- **Independent Commercial Review**: After graph admission, require a separate
  editorial generation to review every mapped requirement, dimension, and
  claim for support, depth, temporal status, scope, language, and source-summary
  prose before a synthesized draft can remain successful
- **Evidence-Preserving Editorial Planning**: Let the independent editor improve
  claim phrasing, natural section headings, and paragraph groupings only after
  the claim graph is complete; the Host verifies exact claim identity, numeric
  preservation, dependency order, and one-time placement of every finding
- **Continuous Argument Rendering**: Render claims in authored paragraph order
  without fixed evidence/analysis/recommendation subheadings, while keeping
  basis edges and reproducible derivations available in a collapsed
  traceability disclosure
- **Fixed A3S Report Design**: Render every HTML publication outcome through
  one A3S Code Web-aligned token system; legacy presentation metadata cannot
  change the palette, hero, density, typography, or section composition. The
  shared renderer uses a sticky left action menu, a centered report surface,
  and a sticky right table of contents on desktop; narrow screens stack the
  action menu and table of contents ahead of the report without page overflow
- **Progressive Publication**: Preserve a source-backed report before attempting
  a typed claim graph and independent editorial review
- **Explicit Evidence Boundaries**: Publish a no-evidence report when no source
  can safely support conclusions
- **Crash-Safe Artifacts**: Replace Markdown and HTML as one digest-verified,
  recoverable generation
- **Run-Scoped Recovery**: Bind terminal publication to the exact run, query,
  quality metrics, and full artifact hashes
- **Typed Lifecycle Events**: Emit run, stage, publication, cancellation, and
  failure events without inferring state from report prose
- **Cooperative Cancellation**: Drop in-flight port futures and prevent later
  stages from publishing after cancellation
- **Explicit Workspace Hints**: Acquire validated relative context paths through
  the same exact-path provenance boundary as discovered workspace evidence
- **Replaceable Product Ports**: Keep model execution, workflow runtime,
  artifact storage, provider policy, and progress presentation in the host
- **Replayable Contracts**: Exercise production control flow with frozen,
  domain-neutral fixtures and typed fault injection

### Publication outcomes

Every completed run returns one closed publication outcome.

| Outcome | Admission state | Reader-visible result |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `Synthesized` | Admitted claims close every material dimension | Typed report with validated claims, relations, derivations, and citations |
| `Qualified` | Useful admitted claims remain, with an explicit material gap | Typed report that preserves both supported findings and the unresolved gap |
| `SourceBacked` | Sources are semantically admitted, but final synthesis is unavailable or rejected | Staged source report with no synthesized claim graph |
| `NoEvidence` | No source passes semantic admission | Boundary report that makes no domain conclusion |

Raw acquisition may be retained for audit and recovery, but it never becomes
claim evidence merely because a provider returned it.

## Quick Start

### Installation

```toml
[dependencies]
a3s-deep-research = "0.1.3"
serde_json = "1"
```

The engine uses async ports. The host chooses its executor, model client,
workflow runtime, search providers, persistence, and presentation layer.

### Implement the product ports

| Port | Host responsibility |
| --- | --- |
| `StructuredGenerationPort` | Execute the closed planning and report-object contracts |
| `WorkflowExecutionPort` | Run bootstrap and planned retrieval workflows |
| `PublicationPort` | Materialize the requested report class and return exact artifact paths |
| `ProgressPort` | Persist or present typed run, stage, publication, cancellation, and failure events |

All four traits are `Send + Sync`. `NoopProgress` is available when the host
does not need progress events. Existing implementations of `report_progress`
continue to receive stage events; new adapters should implement `report_event`
to preserve the complete lifecycle.

### Configure execution limits

`EngineLimits::default()` supplies bounded planner, retrieval, report, retry,
and durable-generation grace periods. A host may replace those values with
`with_limits`, but invalid zero-length or unbounded generation settings fail
contract validation before research starts.

Search-engine selection and provider fallback are host runtime policy. A
provider outage or exhausted quota can trigger another provider without
changing the evidence contract: fallback bytes still require the same semantic
admission as bytes from the preferred provider.

`WorkflowExecutionPort` adapters may attach a bounded
`RetrievalRunProvenanceEnvelopeV1` under the reserved top-level
`WorkflowOutput.metadata["retrieval_run_provenance"]` key. The adapter must
first validate each producer receipt against its returned output and retain the
complete receipt plus the verification material required by that producer. The
`receipt_sha256` field records the producer-defined canonical complete-receipt
binding; it is not required to hash the receipt's JSON representation. For a
Search cascade, map `outcome.receipt_binding()?.sha256` to
`receipt_sha256`, the typed `SearchQuery` binding to `request_sha256`, and the
complete ordered `SearchResults` binding to `output_sha256`. The quality floor
and declared tier plan are covered by the complete receipt binding, not by the
SearchQuery binding. DeepResearch does not depend on the Search crate or
inspect tier/provider names. The engine shape-validates and carries this
adapter assertion in terminal
`execution.retrieval_run_provenance` audit metadata. The top-level key is
host-reserved by convention, not a cryptographically separate channel; nested
tool metadata is ignored, and an invalid optional envelope is recorded as
rejected.

Retrieval provenance is deliberately excluded from planning, evidence
admission, report generation, and publication-quality calculations. A
shape-valid envelope states only which retrieval output the adapter says it
validated. It does not make a source relevant, fetched, independent, primary,
claim-eligible, or sufficient for publication, and it does not establish
external authenticity unless an independent authority authenticates the
producer-defined complete-receipt binding, for example by signing or
append-only logging `receipt_sha256`. A failed `WorkflowExecutionPort` call
returns no `WorkflowOutput`, so durable provenance for failed attempts must
remain in the adapter's external append-only attempt log rather than this
optional successful-output channel.

## Engine Model

Bootstrap retrieval and semantic planning begin together. Planning may define
up to 24 atomic request requirements, map them to at most eight evidence tracks,
and return at most 15 supplemental queries. It cannot return URLs, choose
transport budgets, replace the exact query, or publish facts. If planning is
invalid or unavailable, the engine continues from the exact query under a
conservative comprehensive, freshness-aware gate.

For web-capable evidence scopes, the Host also extracts at most three explicit
HTTP(S) references from the exact user query as direct retrieval seeds. It
removes fragments, rejects credential-bearing or malformed references, and
deduplicates normalized URLs. `local_only` scope never emits these seeds and
remains network-free.

```

Every selected web candidate is a separate durable workflow effect. Sibling
steps are recorded before external effects begin, successful outputs are
persisted independently, and aggregation uses candidate indexes rather than
completion order. A completed source can therefore be reused after restart,
while an ambiguous running effect is redelivered with the same attempt under
at-least-once semantics.

When typed coverage remains incomplete, up to four gap-directed rounds may use
unused discovery results, explicit HTTPS references from admitted evidence, and
new queries generated only from typed missing criteria or source roles. Each
unresolved track is expanded into one ordered target per missing atomic
criterion; role-only targets enter after their criteria are otherwise covered.
The Host contract derives a maximum of 24 new queries from the eight-track,
three-criteria envelope and permits at most 16 supplemental fetches in total.
The workflow rotates those targets fairly across up to four rounds, reserves
capacity for the later round, subtracts the first round's actual scheduled
effects, and never owns a duplicate numeric budget. Every fetched reference
passes the same closed semantic evidence selection.

Replay decisions use only exact run, stage, step, and candidate identities plus
typed state. Retrieval retries are equally closed: only object-shaped error
metadata whose exact `type` is `timeout` or `transport` authorizes the one
bounded fetch retry. Missing, malformed, string-valued, or unknown error kinds
are terminal at this layer regardless of their prose.

## Evidence Contract

The Host-projected inquiry collection is the sole semantic admission authority.
Web and workspace sources both enter through exact selected source/chunk IDs
and typed relationships:

- track relevance admits a source for an atomic claim on that exact track;
- completion-criterion coverage records which declared obligation a source
  satisfies;
- criterion-scoped primary and independent roles record the required source
  shape;
- one final closed attribution partition maps every selected source exactly
  once to an accountable-origin group, while a separate positive edge set
  records only group pairs whose independent attribution is established;
- facts cite admitted source and chunk IDs;
- inferences and recommendations name admitted basis claims;
- derived claims retain their method and exact input claim IDs;
- contradiction relations preserve both supported claims;
- typed gaps bind unresolved obligations to their material dimensions.

Track relevance never closes a completion criterion, criterion coverage never
manufactures a claim, and a source role never manufactures attribution
independence. A focused report may publish one structurally
sufficient cited claim. A comprehensive report reaches `Synthesized` only when
its admitted graph closes every material dimension. A report with both deeply
analyzed resolved dimensions and unresolved dimensions may remain `Qualified`
with explicit typed gaps, but `Qualified` is never a successful completed
research result. When every dimension is unresolved, the Host admits at most
one qualified partial preview, and only if that bounded dimension independently
satisfies the full two-source analytical depth gate and retains its gap.

The typed comprehensive gate retains the report-wide floor of one direct
answer, five supporting findings, six admitted claims, two cited sources, and
1,200 information-bearing Unicode letter-or-number characters in claim prose.
It also evaluates every resolved material dimension independently. Each such
dimension needs exactly one leading answer,
at least two factual findings whose support spans a positively verified pair of
independent attribution groups, at least three analytical claims covering
comparison, explanation, and implication, one explicit challenge or boundary,
one cross-source synthesis, and 1,200 substantive characters. The generation
contract asks those analytical steps to cover source comparison, mechanism or
trade-off, practical implication, and an applicability boundary or
counterexample. Repeated openings and near-duplicate claim prose are rejected;
multi-cited facts, three paraphrases of one conclusion, and source-by-source
summaries do not satisfy this requirement.

The engine persists both the number of resolved material dimensions and the
number that passed this deeper gate. A synthesized report is valid only when
those counts are equal and every material requirement is resolved. A qualified
artifact may preserve supported partial work, but its nonzero gap count keeps
it incomplete at every CLI, TUI, and Web success boundary. The all-bounded
preview is represented explicitly as zero resolved dimensions, one deeply
analyzed bounded dimension, exactly one direct answer, and at least one typed
gap. Restart recovery therefore cannot promote an older report whose aggregate
metrics hide a thin section.

After the graph is complete, an independent editorial generation receives the
exact query, current date, mapped requirements, admitted claims, and only the
closed evidence excerpts cited by those claims. It must review every dimension
and every claim, classify fact temporal status, and return evidence-preserving
rewrites plus a bounded narrative plan. The Host rejects missing or duplicate
reviews, inconsistent readiness, unsupported temporal classes, numeric drift,
changed claim identities, dependency inversions, or shallow/source-summary
dimensions. A synthesized draft that fails this review falls back to the staged
source-backed artifact instead of becoming successful. Renderers project an
admitted plan as continuous prose while retaining basis edges and derivations
in a collapsed traceability disclosure.

An inference or recommendation may combine admitted premises from other
dimensions through explicit basis edges. Those edges do not manufacture
criterion coverage. After claim admission, the Host recomputes coverage from
the sources actually used by the accepted claims and adds a typed gap when that
smaller evidence set no longer satisfies a declared source requirement.

Small source catalogs use one closed selector. Larger catalogs are partitioned
into byte-bounded source-aware JSON windows with lossless source-local recovery,
followed by an exact-ID reduction that retains at most four excerpts per source.
The current report attempt receives a generated JSON Schema whose dimension,
source, and chunk enums contain only that closed packet. When declared
independence otherwise appears complete, a global attribution pass receives
every currently selected source with byte-bounded excerpts but no URL field.
If it identifies a missing independent pair, that exact typed role gap can
drive the remaining supplemental retrieval budget. A changed final portfolio
is reviewed again; an unchanged one reuses the prior result. The Host rejects
unknown, duplicate, or missing source IDs, canonicalizes the complete
partition, closes groups again when report-source canonicalization merges
aliases, and discards any independence edge that collapses to one final group.
Different IDs, URLs, hosts, languages, wording, or singleton groups never
establish independence by themselves.

Reader prose is untrusted data. The Host never derives identity, relevance, or
evidence support from query, claim, source, title, URL, publisher, numbers, or
punctuation. It does pin `report_language` to the request-owned output language
and rejects obvious aggregate prose-language mismatches. Source-defined names
and quotations may remain in their original language. Reader-facing labels and
evidence-boundary prose arrive inside the typed proposal, are shape-validated,
and are rendered as inert text.

The planner writes titles, tracks, criteria, and the final report in the pinned
reader language. Supplemental retrieval queries may use a source's native
language when that materially improves recall; this never changes the report
language.

## Publication and Recovery

Publication is progressive. Once evidence is semantically admitted, the engine
stages a source-backed Markdown/HTML pair before report generation. A failed,
timed-out, invalid, or commercially rejected synthesized proposal cannot erase
it. If synthesized publication
returns an ambiguous error after touching the pair, the engine resolves the
exact run receipt and otherwise re-publishes the closed source snapshot.

Markdown and HTML are installed as one crash-recoverable generation. The
publisher syncs the new files and bounded copies of the previous pair before
installing a transaction journal containing exact local file identities and
full SHA-256 digests. Recovery keeps the new generation only when both target
digests match; otherwise it restores the complete previous pair. An interrupted
first publication is removed instead of exposing mismatched formats.

A successful publication also persists a run-scoped receipt before the port
returns. New product adapters write the report pair under
`.a3s/research/artifacts/<run-id>/`; legacy query-slug reports remain readable
but are no longer the target for new runs. Receipt schema version 5 binds:

- hashes of the exact run identity and query;
- the request-owned output language;
- the closed publication outcome;
- claim, relation, derivation, basis-edge, analytical-claim, cross-source
  synthesis, resolved-dimension, deeply-analyzed-dimension, gap, citation, and
  source metrics;
- the complete Markdown and HTML SHA-256 digests.

Version 1 and 2 receipts remain readable with missing metrics defaulted to
zero, and version 3 remains readable without a language binding. Version 4 has
the language binding but predates per-dimension depth metrics. These receipts
cannot authorize `Qualified` without an explicit gap, and an older
comprehensive receipt cannot pass the current per-dimension depth gate. The
compatibility recovery API may read legacy receipts, while language-bound
recovery treats versions without a language as absent. New recovery paths keep
the version-4 language binding and add the version-5 depth metrics;
`resolve_deep_research_run_publication_in_language` additionally requires a
workflow envelope to carry the same language. If a workflow envelope and
receipt both exist, their outcome, metrics, language, and artifact paths must
agree exactly.

Interrupted acquisition can be retained separately with
`materialize_deep_research_acquisition_recovery_report`. That artifact accepts
only a raw, non-admitted source catalog, uses the exact run identity in its
location, and marks every source ineligible for conclusions. It cannot
overwrite or upgrade a completed report.

## Architecture

The engine owns research state transitions while products own external effects:

| Layer | Owns |
| --- | --- |
| `DeepResearchEngine` | Stage ordering, execution limits, bounded degradation, progressive publication, and terminal metadata |
| Planner | Domain-neutral scope, dimensions, evidence tracks, completion criteria, and supplemental queries |
| Retrieval workflows | Search/fetch orchestration, closed source selection, durable acquisition, and bounded materialization |
| Report pipeline | Source catalog, typed claim graph admission, quality gates, citations, Markdown, and HTML |
| Product adapter | Model calls, workflow tools, provider fallback, artifact storage, progress, and user interaction |

The repository follows the same ownership boundaries:

```text

## Development

Run checks from the `a3s-deep-research` crate directory:

```bash
cargo fmt --all -- --check
cargo test --all-targets --locked
cargo clippy --all-targets --locked -- -D warnings
cargo package --locked
```

### Rust verification

DeepResearch owns its evidence and report-quality verification in this Rust
crate. It does not depend on a separate verifier repository or a second
implementation language. Production code admits typed evidence, validates
claim and source relationships, verifies publication receipts, and binds each
published artifact to its exact run. Deterministic replay and fault tests drive
the same public engine and publication paths used by product hosts.

`tests/commercial_holdout` contains an optional, domain-neutral validator for
signed evaluation campaigns. It verifies candidate and package identities,
preallocated attempts, append-only receipts, artifact roots, review ballots,
and case-level statistics from the supplied records. The validator does not
contain a corpus, provider preference, topic rule, publisher allowlist,
language branch, or query matcher. Supplying a signed campaign is an operator
choice and is not a dependency of the normal release workflow.

The release workflow packages one exact crate, runs the Rust contract and
replay suite, rechecks the frozen package digest on a clean job, and publishes
that artifact as the GitHub release asset. Repository rules and protected
environments remain the appropriate place for tag and credential governance.

The test suite covers cross-topic structural isomorphism, exact-query
authority, domain-neutral planning, closed source selection, typed provenance,
report admission, artifact transaction faults, receipt recovery, and embedded
JavaScript workflow execution.

Frozen F01-F08 fixtures pass through `DeepResearchEngine::execute` using the
same production contracts. Their control flow varies only closed protocol
enums, exact identities, explicit graph edges, and injected typed failures.
The publication fault suite interrupts both report-file replacements and
verifies rollback, commit recognition, first-generation cleanup, and recovery
through the normal report resolver.
