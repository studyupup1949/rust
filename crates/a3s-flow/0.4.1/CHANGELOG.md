This release promotes A3S Flow into the durable Rust workflow SDK for A3S.

  run history.
- Added local JSONL, SQLite, and Postgres event stores, plus local and Postgres
  task queues for worker-based execution.
- Added scheduler and worker helpers for suspended runs, task leasing,
  wake-up delay calculation, and recovery after host restarts.
- Added run inspection APIs for summaries, open suspensions, next wake-up time,
  active hooks, and event history.
- Added typed serde helpers for step payloads, workflow input, workflow output,
  and hook metadata.
- Added a native TypeScript authoring contract, runtime bridge, preflight
  validation, and runnable TypeScript workflow examples.

  local audit log example.
