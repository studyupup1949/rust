//! Portable coding-agent CLI and `SKILL.md` operations.
//!
//! The module is intentionally separate from the gateway data plane. Agent
//! profiles describe native CLI contracts, [`AgentRegistry`] owns extension,
//! [`AgentRuntime`] owns process execution, and [`SkillCatalog`] owns read-only
//! Skill discovery. Together they form a local operations surface, not a
//! remote management control plane. No command is evaluated through a shell.
