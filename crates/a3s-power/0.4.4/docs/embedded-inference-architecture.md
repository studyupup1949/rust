# Embedded Inference Architecture

A3S Power provides a model-neutral native Rust inference substrate. Model
architectures do not belong in Power: OCR networks belong in `a3s-ocr`, and
other product models remain in their owning crates. Power supplies the common
execution, placement, integrity, resource, and privacy mechanisms those model
crates share.

This design borrows systems ideas from
[A3S-Lab/colibri](https://github.com/A3S-Lab/colibri/tree/b085b48888a88d9a1c00b151a9979774b72cdbfd)
at pinned revision `b085b48888a88d9a1c00b151a9979774b72cdbfd`, while
retaining Power's TEE, encrypted-model, signature, attestation, resource-bound,
and receipt features. No Colibri source code is copied into Power.

## Ownership Boundary

| Concern | Owner |
| --- | --- |
| Tensor kernels, typed devices, admission, cancellation, limits | `a3s-power` |
| Static graph validation and reviewed operator execution | `a3s-power` |
| Storage/RAM/device weight placement and telemetry policy | `a3s-power` |
| Model family, topology, graph identity, and revision | Model crate |
| Tokenizer, preprocessing, postprocessing, and generation loop | Model crate |
| Product orchestration and document structure | Product crate |

Power therefore contains no PP-OCR, Unlimited-OCR, or other model assets,
tokenizers, conversion tools, or revision hashes.

## Runtime Shape

```text
model crate
  ├─ model-owned reviewed plans and native control flow
  ├─ one EmbeddedRuntime per model session
  └─ one ExecutionPermit per logical request
       │
       ├─ GraphExecutor ───────── validated dense/static graphs
       ├─ RoutedExpertBatch ───── exact batch union, no route changes
       └─ WeightHierarchy
            ├─ device cache ───── bounded, typed device, exact dtype
            ├─ host cache ─────── per-layer LRU + explicit hot pins
            ├─ prefetch pool ───── bounded tasks and blocking workers
            ├─ residency plan ──── atomic heat-ranked weight groups
            └─ SafeTensors ─────── mmap-backed, hash-verified storage
```

A logical request holds one permit across every component graph. A multimodal
model must not create independent admission, device, hash, receipt, or cache
systems for its vision encoder, projector, dense layers, and routed experts.

## Colibri Ideas Adapted as Generic Mechanisms

- Storage, host RAM, and accelerator memory form one typed weight hierarchy.
  Placement changes latency only; tensor dtype and shape are checked after each
  transfer and are never silently converted.
- Routed weights load on demand. Layer-local LRU eviction is bounded by both an
  entry cap and byte budgets. Explicit pins form a hot resident set and cannot
  be evicted to admit a colder weight.
- `RoutedExpertBatch` unions repeated expert IDs across batch positions so each
  unique expert can be staged once. Original expert order, gate weight, and
  top-k selection remain intact.
- `start_prefetch` starts bounded blocking I/O immediately. The hierarchy caps
  active tasks and workers, unions duplicate requests, and propagates
  cancellation when the task is aborted or dropped. A model can prefetch layer
  N+1, compute layer N, then await the task, providing the one-layer-ahead
  overlap used by routed models.
- Per-key load serialization prevents a demand load and a concurrent prefetch
  from materializing the same tensor twice.
- `plan_residency` converts model-supplied atomic weight groups and measured heat
  into a deterministic device/host/storage plan. It respects exact byte budgets
  and per-layer entry limits, never splits a group, and binds the plan to the
  weight digest, runtime device, and policy. Applying a plan is transactional
  with respect to cache entries and pin flags touched by the operation.
- CPU, CUDA, and Metal are explicit device choices. An unavailable explicit
  device fails instead of silently moving execution elsewhere.
- Runtime limits bound graph plans, tensor elements, resident weights, model
  state, context, generation, and concurrency. Model-owned KV or recurrent
  state must call `checked_state_bytes` before allocation.
- Placement and routing telemetry are controlled by `TelemetryMode`. It is off
  by default. Detailed expert heat can reveal input semantics, is never logged
  or persisted automatically, and must remain inside the TEE unless policy
  explicitly authorizes export.

## Integrity and TEE Invariants

- `WeightStore` hashes every SafeTensors file and a deterministic aggregate
  manifest before mapping it. Model crates pin the aggregate digest with
  `verify_integrity` and may reuse Power's Ed25519 model seal verification with
  `verify_signature`.
- Embedded inference does not bind a socket, start a Web server, download a
  model, invoke Python, or spawn an inference service.
- The server, API, CLI, model registry, remote clients, and Web dependencies are
  behind the default `server` feature. An embedded-only build disables default
  features, so its dependency closure contains no HTTP server/client stack and
  does not enable Tokio networking, process, or signal support.
- Existing encrypted model loading, remote attestation, privacy redaction,
  request receipts, and zeroizing sensitive request buffers remain independent
  security controls; the embedded runtime does not replace them.
- Routing history is bound to the exact weight digest. Power only returns a
  serializable value; persistence must use a model-owned encrypted or sealed
  store. Plaintext sidecar files are not created.
- Placement telemetry contains no tensor values. Detailed routing identifiers
  are still sensitive metadata and are opt-in.
- Residency candidates and plans can reveal the learned hot set. Power returns
  them to the caller but never logs or persists them automatically.

## Colibri Adoption Boundaries

| Colibri mechanism | Power treatment |
| --- | --- |
| VRAM/RAM/storage as one hierarchy | Implemented generically with exact dtype and shape checks |
| Layer-local LRU and learned hot pins | Implemented; model crates define atomic weight groups only |
| Batched expert union | Implemented without changing router order, top-k, or gate weights |
| One-layer-ahead I/O overlap | Implemented with bounded, cancellable Tokio blocking workers |
| Hardware-aware placement | Deterministic budget planner implemented; OS discovery and benchmarking remain follow-up work |
| Multi-drive weighted mirrors and direct I/O | Planned as storage backends under `WeightStore`, not a parallel cache system |
| Routing-history sidecar | Plaintext automatic persistence is intentionally not adopted; TEE policy owns sealed storage |
| Cache-aware expert substitution | Not enabled because it changes model semantics; exact routing is the default invariant |
| Speculative decoding and KV policy | Model control flow remains in the model crate; Power supplies shared state bounds and receipts |
| Web dashboard | Not part of embedded inference; an explicit external consumer may receive policy-approved aggregate telemetry |

## Validation Gates

Every model integration must publish reproducible evidence for:

1. output parity against a pinned upstream implementation;
2. exact model revision, graph-plan digest, and weight digest;
3. cold and warm latency, peak host/device memory, bytes read, cache hit rate,
   and prefetch hit rate on named hardware;
4. identical outputs with caching and prefetch disabled versus enabled;
5. cancellation, resource-limit, malformed-plan, and wrong-digest failures;
6. TEE regression tests, including telemetry-off behavior and no plaintext
   persistence.

An optimization is not enabled by default from a microbenchmark alone. It must
preserve model semantics and improve an end-to-end workload under a documented
hardware and cache state.

## Deliberate Follow-up Work

The current foundation does not yet implement verified multi-drive mirrors,
automatic OS-level hardware discovery and benchmarking, encrypted persistent
model state, or a cross-model benchmark runner. These should extend the same
runtime and integrity primitives rather than introduce parallel model-specific
systems.
