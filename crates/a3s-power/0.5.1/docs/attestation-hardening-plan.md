# A3S Power Attestation Hardening Plan

Status: immediate remediation in progress
Scope: A3S Power TEE and NVIDIA GPU confidential-computing attestation soundness
Current code baseline reviewed locally: `4efcd1c`

## Purpose

This plan responds to the coordinated disclosure report covering model hash
enforcement, cached attestation state, optional hardware verification, simulated
TEE acceptance, encrypted model hash semantics, CPU/GPU attestation binding, and
runtime policy claims.

The goal is to make the production attestation path fail closed by default and
to make the verifier's claim set match what Power actually runs.

NVIDIA GPU support is a production requirement for Power. This plan therefore
separates ordinary CUDA acceleration from NVIDIA GPU confidential-computing
attestation: ordinary CUDA can remain a supported performance mode, while
`gpu-confidential` must fail closed unless NVIDIA evidence is configured,
verified by the deployment's NVIDIA flow, and cryptographically bound to the
CPU TEE evidence. It must also fail closed when the final runtime GPU execution
configuration is CPU-only.

## Patch Status

Landed in the current working tree:

- Added `tee_policy_mode` with `development`, `strict`, and
  `gpu-confidential` modes. The default is `strict`.
- Made strict policy reject simulated TEE by default through the effective TEE
  allowlist.
- Made strict and `gpu-confidential` startup require a 48-byte
  `expected_measurements` launch-measurement pin for the detected hardware TEE
  type, then self-check that the current attestation report matches it.
- Made strict TEE startup require `model_hashes` or `model_signing_key`, and
  require every registered local model to be pinned when no signing key is
  configured.
- Added NVIDIA GPU confidential-computing evidence providers for configured
  evidence/verdict bytes, live `nvattest-cli`, and direct `nras-rest`
  attestation. `gpu-confidential` now fails closed unless GPU evidence and an
  NRAS/NVAT verdict digest are bound into v2 claims and the final runtime
  configuration enables GPU execution/offload.
- Added production startup validation for NVIDIA GPU confidential-computing
  metadata: `gpu-confidential` requires the canonical `nvidia-nras` provider
  label, an absolute executable `nvattest_path` for the live CLI path, HTTPS
  custom NRAS/RIM/OCSP service URLs without embedded credentials, and an
  absolute existing non-empty relying-party policy file when one is configured;
  file-backed configured and direct NRAS REST evidence/verdict sources must
  also use absolute paths to existing non-empty regular files.
- Changed `/v1/attestation?model=...` to re-hash the current local model
  artifact and fail on missing, malformed, or stale model hashes instead of
  silently omitting the model binding.
- Changed `/v1/attestation` to reject unknown query parameters instead of
  silently dropping caller-supplied attestation policy.
- Added deterministic directory-manifest hashing for HuggingFace/Vision-style
  model directories and emits `directory-manifest-sha256` model claims.
- Model registration now rejects unsupported `format` values and unknown
  top-level registration or pull request fields instead of silently defaulting
  local artifacts to GGUF or dropping caller-supplied model policy.
- SafeTensors and vision model loading now reject explicit invalid
  `default_parameters.isq` values instead of silently falling back to Q8_0.
- Added typed encrypted model digest semantics. Explicit `model_hashes` pins
  encrypted models by decrypted plaintext SHA-256 and model claims include both
  `plaintext_digest` and `ciphertext_digest`; manifest-only fallback emits an
  explicit `ciphertext-artifact-sha256` claim.
- Tightened verifier-side model digest claim validation so plaintext,
  ciphertext, and directory-manifest digest kinds must be internally
  consistent with their typed optional digest fields.
- Added `VerificationPolicy` and `verify_report_strict()` so production
  verifier callers fail when hardware signature verification is missing and
  reject simulated TEE reports; strict verification now also requires an
  operator-pinned launch measurement.
- Made `a3s-power-verify` default to strict verification; skipping hardware
  signatures and measurement pinning now requires explicit `--allow-offline`,
  while strict mode requires `--expected-measurement`.
- Added `AttestationClaimsV2`, model digest claims, GPU evidence claims,
  canonical JSON hashing, and CPU TEE `report_data` binding for model-bound
  and GPU-confidential attestations.
- Updated verifier logic so reports with v2 claims verify nonce/model/GPU
  digests and GPU evidence provider/format/count pins from the canonical claims
  and reject mismatched claims/report_data bindings.
- Added runtime policy claims for model-bound attestations. Power now hashes
  applied chat templates and canonical GPU execution/offload parameters into
  `AttestationClaimsV2`; unapplied manifest system prompts, pre-seeded
  messages, and default generation parameters are intentionally not claimed.
- Added verifier and CLI checks for runtime policy digests via
  `VerificationPolicy::require_runtime_policy()` and
  `a3s-power-verify --require-runtime-policy`.
- Added `VerificationPolicy::gpu_confidential()` /
  `require_gpu_confidential()` and `a3s-power-verify --gpu-confidential` so
  production NVIDIA GPU confidential-computing verifiers can require v2 claims,
  nonce freshness, an expected NVIDIA NRAS verdict digest, verifier-pinned GPU
  provider/format/count policy, structured device claims, verifier-pinned GPU
  topology, claims schema version, identity/version policy, secure-boot/debug
  state, runtime policy, and GPU execution/offload digest pinning as one
  profile. The production GPU profile no longer accepts raw evidence digest
  pinning as a substitute for pinning the NRAS verdict digest.
- Added per-request inference receipts for `/v1/chat/completions` and
  `/v1/completions`. Non-streaming responses include `attestation_receipt` and
  `attestation_receipt_sha256`; streaming responses emit a final receipt event
  before `[DONE]`. Receipt v2 includes the same runtime
  chat-template/GPU execution policy claim semantics used by model-bound
  attestation.
- OpenAI-compatible chat and completion requests now expose extended local
  sampling controls (`top_k`, `min_p`, `repeat_penalty`, `repeat_last_n`,
  `penalize_newline`, `num_ctx`, `mirostat*`, `tfs_z`, and `typical_p`), pass
  them through to backend inference requests, and include them in receipt
  decoding-parameter hashes.
- OpenAI-compatible chat requests preserve `parallel_tool_calls` through the
  remote/proxy inference path and include it in receipt decoding-parameter
  hashes. Local chat backends reject `parallel_tool_calls=false` when tools are
  provided because they cannot enforce single tool-call generation.
- OpenAI-compatible chat and completion requests now explicitly accept the
  default single-choice output (`n = 1`) and reject unsupported multi-choice
  requests, with explicit `n` values covered by receipt decoding-parameter
  hashes.
- OpenAI-compatible text completion requests now explicitly reject `suffix`
  fill-in-the-middle requests instead of silently dropping the suffix before
  backend inference or receipt comparison.
- OpenAI-compatible chat and text completion requests now explicitly reject
  logprob response-shape requests, and text completions reject `echo = true`,
  instead of silently returning ordinary responses without the requested fields.
- OpenAI-compatible chat and text completion requests now explicitly reject
  `logit_bias`, and text completions accept only the default-equivalent
  `best_of = 1`, with explicit `best_of` values covered by receipt hashes.
- OpenAI-compatible chat and completion requests preserve unknown top-level
  request fields during parsing and reject them instead of silently dropping
  unsupported output or provider policy before backend inference and receipt
  binding.
- OpenAI-compatible chat requests now support `max_completion_tokens` as an
  alias for the backend generated-token limit, reject conflicts with
  `max_tokens`, and include both aliases in receipt decoding-parameter hashes.
- OpenAI-compatible chat requests now map legacy `functions` and
  `function_call` fields onto modern `tools` and `tool_choice`, reject mixed
  legacy/modern tool policy fields, preserve function `strict` schema flags,
  and bind the effective tool policy in receipts.
- OpenAI-compatible chat requests preserve unknown nested tool definition
  fields during parsing and reject them instead of silently dropping tool
  schema or tool wrapper policy before proxy forwarding and receipt binding.
- OpenAI-compatible chat requests now reject local-backend tool-choice
  policies that Power cannot enforce (`tool_choice = "none"` with tools,
  `tool_choice = "required"`, or named tool/function choices), while preserving
  those policies for remote/proxy models that can enforce them upstream.
- OpenAI-compatible chat requests preserve unknown nested `tool_choice` and
  legacy `function_call` fields during parsing and reject them instead of
  silently dropping tool-selection policy before proxy forwarding and receipt
  binding.
- OpenAI-compatible chat requests now reject message-level `thinking` input
  instead of receipt-binding reasoning content that is not forwarded into
  backend prompt construction.
- OpenAI-compatible chat requests preserve unknown nested message, content-part,
  and image URL fields during parsing and reject them instead of silently
  dropping prompt or multimodal policy before proxy forwarding and receipt
  binding.
- OpenAI-compatible local chat backends now reject unsupported message roles
  instead of silently coercing unknown roles to `user`; remote/proxy models keep
  role passthrough for upstream enforcement.
- OpenAI-compatible chat requests now accept only the default text output
  modality (`modalities = ["text"]`) and reject unsupported output controls
  (`audio`, `prediction`, and `reasoning_effort`) instead of silently ignoring
  response-shape requests that backend inference and receipts cannot honor.
- OpenAI-compatible chat and completion requests now reject unsupported
  `response_format.type` values and incomplete `json_schema` response formats
  as well as unknown nested response-format policy fields instead of
  receipt-binding output constraints that local backends cannot enforce.
- Added opt-in proxy upstream effective-prompt digest support. Proxy receipts
  remain non-overclaiming by default; when configured, Power asks the upstream
  digest endpoint for a `chat.rendered-prompt` SHA-256 before inference and can
  fail closed if the endpoint is required.
- Added mistralrs text-chat effective-prompt coverage using a
  domain-separated SHA-256 over the exact prompt token ID sequence returned by
  mistralrs' own tokenization path. This is emitted as
  `kind = "chat.prompt-token-ids"` rather than pretending to be rendered bytes.
- Fixed OpenAI-compatible message-level `images` forwarding into backend chat
  requests and mistralrs multimodal image detection/decoding for those
  message-level payloads, with regression coverage, so Ollama-native base64
  multimodal payloads are not dropped before inference.
- Fixed llama.cpp chat image collection to include request-level `images` and
  made llama.cpp multimodal chat leave `effective_prompt` absent instead of
  overclaiming a text-only rendered prompt digest.
- Made picolm reject image-bearing chat requests fail-closed and leave
  `effective_prompt` absent for image-bearing requests instead of silently
  rendering only the text parts.
- Fixed proxy chat request bodies to preserve structured multimodal content,
  message images, tools, tool choice, parallel tool-call policy, response
  format, function `strict` schema flags, and extended sampling controls when
  forwarding inference and when requesting an upstream
  `effective_prompt` digest.
- Preserved OpenAI `json_schema` response-format wire shape for remote/proxy
  chat requests while keeping local backend schema extraction unchanged, and
  reject unknown nested response-format fields before forwarding or receipt
  binding.
- Added OpenAI completion `response_format` coverage through API parsing,
  backend/proxy forwarding, and request receipt binding.
- Forwarded OpenAI `stream_options` for streaming requests through backend
  requests and proxy chat/completion bodies so receipt-bound streaming protocol
  choices reach remote upstreams. Non-streaming requests now reject
  `stream_options` instead of receipt-binding options that cannot affect the
  response shape, and unsupported nested stream option fields are preserved
  during parsing and rejected instead of being silently dropped before receipt
  binding.
- Added regression tests for strict policy, runtime model-hash binding, stale
  model-file rejection, GPU confidential fail-closed behavior, runtime policy
  digest binding, proxy and mistralrs effective-prompt digest handling, request
  receipts, multimodal receipt input-digest coverage, and strict verifier
  behavior.
- Fixed live `a3s-power-verify --url` attestation fetches to build URLs with a
  URL parser, preserving deployment base paths, dropping stale query/fragment
  components, and percent-encoding query parameters so model names containing
  query-special characters are not misparsed during verifier-side nonce/model
  binding.
- Fixed `a3s-power` model-management CLI URL construction to percent-encode
  model names as path segments for `models show` / `models rm`, so names with
  `/`, `:`, spaces, or query-special characters resolve to the intended model.
- Fixed remote model hub URL construction to use a URL parser for download and
  file-list endpoints, preserving intended repo/file subdirectories while
  percent-encoding spaces and query-special characters and rejecting empty or
  dot path segments in local references.
- Fixed remote hub token resolution to use the selected source's token
  environment variable plus the generic `A3S_POWER_HUB_TOKEN`, avoiding
  accidental cross-use of HuggingFace and ModelScope credentials.
- Bounded remote hub file-list API response bodies so malformed ModelScope or
  HuggingFace file-list endpoints cannot force unbounded memory growth before
  JSON parsing.
- Tightened remote hub download accounting so known-size model downloads fail
  if the response exceeds the declared size or the completed byte count
  overflows, before writing an oversized chunk into the partial file.
- Tightened remote hub resume handling so stale partial downloads larger than
  the declared model size are removed and rejected instead of being treated as
  complete artifacts.
- Tightened remote hub download completion checks so known-size downloads must
  receive exactly the declared byte count before the partial file is promoted
  into the blob store.
- Made blob integrity verification hash model files with the existing streaming
  SHA-256 path instead of reading whole model artifacts into memory.
- Made `A3S_POWER_MODEL_SOURCE` fail closed for unknown configured values
  instead of silently falling back to ModelScope.
- Fixed proxy backend endpoint URL construction to use a URL parser, preserving
  upstream base paths, dropping stale query/fragment components, and
  percent-encoding configured effective-prompt digest path segments.
- Tightened proxy SSE parsing so complete `data:` lines are rejected when the
  line plus newline would exceed the per-event buffer limit.
- Made proxy SSE parsing buffer raw bytes and decode only complete event lines,
  so multibyte UTF-8 split across network chunks is not silently corrupted.
- Tightened proxy chat/completion SSE event parsing so upstream error objects
  and malformed stream chunks fail closed instead of being silently converted
  to empty output.
- Tightened proxy stream parsing so empty `choices` events are accepted only
  for usage-only chunks and otherwise fail closed.
- Tightened proxy stream parsing so multi-choice upstream chunks fail closed
  instead of silently dropping all but the first choice.
- Tightened proxy stream parsing so blank `finish_reason` values fail closed
  instead of being forwarded as empty done reasons.
- Preserved proxy chat stream reasoning and tool-call deltas while making
  malformed tool-call chunks fail closed instead of being silently dropped.
- Added proxy assembly for OpenAI-style incremental streaming tool-call
  deltas, preserving complete tool calls while rejecting incomplete or
  conflicting tool-call streams.
- Bounded proxy streaming tool-call assembly so malicious upstreams cannot
  force unbounded growth through excessive tool calls or accumulated function
  arguments.
- Preserved backend-emitted chat tool calls in non-streaming OpenAI responses
  instead of dropping them while collecting streamed backend chunks.
- Tightened proxy SSE line parsing so malformed non-empty `data:` events fail
  closed instead of being skipped before stream-event validation.
- Tightened proxy SSE EOF handling so truncated partial event lines fail closed
  instead of being treated as a clean stream end.
- Made proxy effective-prompt digest collection leave image-bearing chat
  requests absent by default and fail closed when the digest endpoint is
  required, avoiding text rendered-prompt overclaims for opaque multimodal
  proxy paths.
- Bounded proxy upstream SSE event buffering so malformed streaming responses
  cannot force unbounded memory growth before a complete `data:` line arrives.
- Bounded proxy effective-prompt digest response bodies so malformed upstream
  digest endpoints cannot force unbounded memory growth before JSON parsing.
- Bounded proxy embeddings response bodies before JSON parsing, including
  fail-closed `Content-Length` prechecks for oversized upstream responses.
- Tightened proxy embeddings response parsing so malformed or out-of-range
  embedding vectors fail closed instead of being silently converted to empty or
  partial vectors.
- Tightened proxy embeddings response validation so upstreams must return
  exactly one embedding vector per requested input item.
- Tightened proxy embeddings shape validation so upstream vectors must be
  non-empty and have consistent dimensions within each response.
- Made OpenAI embeddings request encoding explicit: the endpoint accepts the
  default float output or `encoding_format = "float"` and rejects unsupported
  formats such as `base64` instead of silently returning float vectors.
- Made OpenAI embeddings `dimensions` explicit and rejected for now, avoiding
  silent fallback to native model dimensions when a client requests an output
  dimension override.
- OpenAI-compatible embeddings requests preserve unknown top-level request
  fields during parsing and reject them instead of silently dropping unsupported
  provider or abuse-monitoring policy before backend inference.
- Extended receipt policy pins so `ExpectedReceipt` / `verify_receipt_policy`
  can directly require a matching `effective_prompt` digest, while still
  detecting conflicts with explicit effective-prompt absence.
- Tightened verifier CLI effective-prompt backend/kind pins so surrounding
  whitespace is ignored and blank values do not become accidental policy pins.
- Tightened SDK `ExpectedReceipt` effective-prompt backend/kind pins so blank
  values are ignored instead of becoming accidental policy pins or absence
  conflicts.
- Normalized SDK receipt and effective-prompt digest hex pins so direct verifier
  helpers trim surrounding whitespace and share the same `sha256:` parsing path.
- Made `a3s-power-verify --receipt-chat-request-file` require
  `effective_prompt` absence by default for image-bearing chat requests unless
  the verifier explicitly pins an effective-prompt digest/backend/kind, with
  coverage for both rejecting overclaimed image receipts and accepting image
  receipts that keep `effective_prompt` absent.
- Tightened `a3s-power-verify` digest pin parsing so receipt, effective-prompt,
  GPU evidence/verdict, chat-template, decoding-policy, and GPU execution pins
  must be exactly 64-character SHA-256 hex values before verification policy is
  evaluated.
- Tightened GPU evidence/verdict SDK verifier pins so callers must provide full
  32-byte SHA-256 digests instead of relying on mismatch behavior for malformed
  pins.
- Tightened GPU freshness nonce validation so SDK GPU evidence and device-claim
  verification rejects malformed non-32-byte GPU/CPU nonce bindings.
- Tightened v2 claims SDK verifier helpers so direct model, GPU, and runtime
  policy binding checks reject malformed actual claim digest fields before
  policy comparison.
- Tightened v2 claims SDK verifier helpers so direct nonce, GPU metadata,
  structured device-claim, and runtime-policy checks reject unexpected claims
  schema identifiers before accepting policy matches.
- Tightened GPU metadata and structured device-claim SDK verifier helpers so
  they reject malformed GPU evidence claim digests before policy comparison.
- Tightened runtime-policy SDK verifier pins so chat-template, decoding-policy,
  and GPU execution pins must be full 32-byte SHA-256 digests.
- Tightened model-hash verifier pins so SDK and CLI verification require a full
  32-byte SHA-256 digest instead of accepting prefix-length legacy pins.
- Tightened launch-measurement verification so SDK and CLI verification require
  48-byte report measurements and 48-byte expected measurement pins.
- Tightened v2 claims binding verification so self-consistent but malformed
  claim sets are rejected for wrong schema or non-32-byte model/GPU/runtime
  digests before report-data comparison.
- Tightened v2 claims and receipt runtime-policy well-formed checks so empty
  runtime policies, prompt template sources without matching digests, empty GPU
  evidence format labels, and zero GPU evidence counts are rejected before
  report-data or receipt-policy comparison.
- Made attestation JSON hex-byte deserialization reject malformed odd-length
  hex as a serde error instead of panicking while loading external reports.
- Made attestation nonce query decoding reject malformed non-ASCII hex as a
  400 response instead of panicking while parsing client input.
- Made encrypted audit log line decryption reject malformed nonce hex without
  panicking when inspecting corrupted or untrusted audit files.
- Added receipt coverage and verifier pins for streaming-request
  `stream_options`, so clients can distinguish streaming output protocol
  choices such as `include_usage`; unsupported nested stream option fields now
  fail closed during receipt generation and original-request verification.
- Added fail-closed receipt and verifier handling for unknown top-level chat and
  text completion request fields so unsupported request policy cannot be
  silently dropped before hashing.
- Added fail-closed receipt and verifier handling for unknown nested
  `response_format` and `response_format.json_schema` fields so output policy
  extensions cannot be silently dropped before hashing.
- Added fail-closed receipt and verifier handling for unknown chat message,
  content-part, and image URL fields so prompt and multimodal policy extensions
  cannot be silently dropped before hashing.
- Added fail-closed receipt and verifier handling for unknown `tool_choice`,
  `tool_choice.function`, and legacy `function_call` fields so tool-selection
  policy extensions cannot be silently dropped before hashing.
- Added `verify_receipt_matches_chat_request()` and
  `verify_receipt_matches_completion_request()` so SDK verifiers can recompute
  and compare all request-derived receipt fields from the original request,
  including multimodal input digests and exact presence/absence of optional
  output-policy digests, before separately checking attestation runtime policy
  or effective-prompt pins.
- Added text-completion `effective_prompt` receipt coverage for backends that
  own the exact submitted prompt representation. llama.cpp emits the raw text
  prompt digest; picolm and mistralrs reuse their completion-as-chat rendered
  prompt/token-ID digest paths.
- Extended opt-in proxy upstream effective-prompt digest support to text
  completions. When configured, proxy completions send the OpenAI-compatible
  completion body with `stream = false` to the digest endpoint and accept only
  an upstream-declared `text.prompt` SHA-256 claim.
- Tightened receipt well-formed verification so embedded runtime-policy digests
  must be 32-byte SHA-256 values, including prompt, decoding, and GPU execution
  digests.
- Exposed the same original-request receipt comparison through
  `a3s-power-verify --receipt-chat-request-file` and
  `--receipt-completion-request-file`.
- Added strict hardware-verifier operations guidance for AMD SEV-SNP and Intel
  TDX, covering `hw-verify` builds, raw report requirements, AMD KDS / Intel
  PCS outbound access, measurement pins, and production failure handling.
- Added `a3s-power-verify --hw-cert-cache-ttl-secs` so strict verifier
  operators can tune AMD KDS / Intel PCS certificate cache lifetime without
  weakening hardware-signature or measurement requirements.
- Tightened the GPU confidential verifier profile so it requires the top-level
  GPU evidence nonce claim in addition to structured device `eat_nonce`
  freshness checks.
- Consolidated image-bearing chat request detection in
  `ChatRequest::has_image_inputs()` and switched llama.cpp, picolm, and
  mistralrs effective-prompt/rejection gates to that single source of truth, so
  opaque multimodal paths keep `effective_prompt` absent consistently.
- Added API-level image-bearing chat request detection and OpenAI receipt
  regression coverage so vision requests keep `effective_prompt` absent at the
  response boundary when no exact backend prompt representation is available.
- Tightened direct `nras-rest` evidence normalization so DeviceEvidence
  `evidence` and `certificate` fields must be non-empty base64/base64url before
  Power posts them to NVIDIA NRAS, and evidence lists are capped before request
  construction.
- Capped structured NVIDIA GPU/NVSwitch device-claim arrays before verdict
  parsing so nvattest and NRAS verdicts cannot force unbounded claim handling.
- Bounded live `nvattest` child-process output collection so evidence/verdict
  stdout and stderr diagnostics cannot be read into unbounded memory.
- Added a 64 MiB cap for configured GPU evidence and verdict file/hex byte
  sources so malformed deployments fail before unbounded reads or hex decodes.
- Tightened `nras-rest` bearer-token configuration so
  `nras_bearer_token_env` is treated as an environment variable name, trimmed,
  and rejected when empty or not a portable ASCII identifier before Power sends
  NRAS requests; token values are also trimmed and rejected when empty or not
  visible ASCII before they are placed in the Authorization header.
- Tightened direct `nras-rest` endpoint normalization so custom URLs must be an
  HTTPS service root/base path or the full `/v4/attest/gpu` endpoint, without
  embedded credentials, query strings, fragments, or unsupported API-version
  paths; `gpu-confidential` startup validation now applies the same endpoint
  policy before the provider is constructed.
- Tightened direct `nras-rest` detached EAT parsing so only explicit EAT fields
  are decoded as JWTs, malformed token payloads fail closed, and ordinary
  version-like strings elsewhere in the response are ignored.
- Capped direct `nras-rest` detached EAT token collection before JWT decoding so
  explicit token arrays cannot force unbounded verdict parsing work.
- Made picolm `spec_mode` configuration fail closed for unknown A3S ACL or
  `A3S_POWER_SPEC_MODE` values instead of silently falling back to
  `prompt-lookup`.
- Made local raw Jinja chat-template rendering fail closed for llama.cpp and
  picolm when a model-provided template cannot be parsed or rendered, instead
  of silently replacing it with a hardcoded prompt format.
- Made local `response_format` enforcement backend-aware: llama.cpp rejects
  JSON Schema values that cannot be converted or installed as grammar
  constraints, picolm rejects schema-specific constraints it cannot enforce,
  and mistral.rs rejects local response-format constraints instead of silently
  ignoring receipt-bound output policy. Remote models keep upstream passthrough.
- Made `keep_alive` parsing fail closed: invalid config or
  `A3S_POWER_KEEP_ALIVE` values now fail validation, and invalid per-request
  overrides on chat, completion, and embedding endpoints return
  `invalid_keep_alive` instead of falling back to `5m`.
- Made `model_signing_key` fail closed during configuration validation: values
  must be 32-byte hex Ed25519 public keys that parse as verifier keys before
  they can satisfy strict model-integrity policy.
- Tightened `/v1/attestation?model=...` model binding under signing policy:
  when `model_signing_key` is configured and no explicit `model_hashes` pin is
  present, the endpoint re-verifies the current runtime digest signature before
  binding it instead of relying on manifest hash metadata as the expected
  value.
- Made policy-bearing enum environment overrides fail closed:
  `A3S_POWER_TEE_POLICY_MODE` and `A3S_POWER_GPU_ATTESTATION_SOURCE` now reject
  unknown values during configuration loading instead of silently keeping the
  previous/default policy.
- Made policy-bearing boolean environment overrides fail closed:
  `A3S_POWER_TEE_MODE`, `A3S_POWER_REDACT_LOGS`, and proxy effective-prompt
  digest booleans now reject malformed values instead of silently keeping the
  previous/default policy.
- Extended that fail-closed boolean parsing to `A3S_POWER_RA_TLS` and
  `A3S_POWER_AUDIT_LOG`, so malformed RA-TLS or audit logging overrides cannot
  silently leave those controls disabled.
- Made encrypted audit logging configuration fail closed:
  `audit_log_encrypt = true` now requires `audit_key_source` during config
  validation instead of warning and deferring the failure.
- Made audit log startup fail closed: when `audit_log = true`, plain and
  encrypted audit logger open failures now abort startup instead of disabling
  audit logging.
- Made RA-TLS configuration fail closed: `ra_tls = true` now requires both
  `tls_port` and `tee_mode = true`, and configured TLS listeners are rejected
  when the binary was not built with the `tls` feature.
- Made RA-TLS startup fail closed: when `ra_tls = true`, missing TEE providers
  or attestation report generation failures now abort startup before the TLS
  listener binds instead of serving a certificate without the attestation
  extension.
- Made TLS certificate SAN configuration fail closed: invalid `tls_sans`
  entries now fail configuration validation and certificate generation instead
  of being silently skipped.
- Made model key-provider selection fail closed: unknown `key_provider` values
  are rejected, `key_provider = "rotating"` requires at least one
  `key_rotation_sources` entry, and provider construction now follows the
  configured provider type instead of inferring rotation from source presence.
  Provider construction now returns configuration errors instead of warning and
  falling back when a configured provider cannot be built.
- Made transport port environment overrides fail closed:
  malformed `A3S_POWER_PORT`, `A3S_POWER_TLS_PORT`, and
  `A3S_POWER_VSOCK_PORT` values now abort configuration loading instead of
  silently leaving listeners disabled or bound to an unintended fallback port.
- Made remaining numeric environment overrides fail closed:
  malformed `A3S_POWER_MAX_MODELS`, `A3S_POWER_GPU_LAYERS`,
  `A3S_POWER_GPU_ATTESTATION_NRAS_TIMEOUT_SECS`, and
  `A3S_POWER_GPU_ATTESTATION_NVATTEST_TIMEOUT_SECS` values now abort
  configuration loading instead of silently keeping previous values.
- Made `nvattest-cli` GPU attestation configuration fail closed during config
  validation: invalid verifier values, invalid GPU evidence source values, zero
  timeouts, and missing `corelib` GPU architecture now error before provider
  startup.
- Made direct `nras-rest` GPU attestation configuration fail closed during
  config validation: missing evidence, configured external verdicts, missing or
  invalid GPU architecture, invalid claims versions, and zero timeouts now
  error before provider startup.
- Made ambiguous GPU attestation byte sources fail closed during config
  validation: `evidence_hex`/`evidence_path` and `verdict_hex`/`verdict_path`
  are now rejected as mutually exclusive before provider startup.

Still open:

- Expose exact post-template prompt representations for remaining opaque
  multimodal paths, or keep requiring those paths to leave `effective_prompt`
  absent.
- Native NVIDIA GPU confidential-computing NRAS SDK integration. The current
  implementation supports configured evidence/verdict bytes, live
  `nvattest-cli` collection, and direct `nras-rest` attestation, hashes the
  evidence and verdict, extracts structured device claims when verdict claims
  are exposed, and binds them into the CPU TEE report.
- Effective post-template-render request receipts are partial. The current
  receipt covers prompt-bearing API input, model runtime
  chat-template/GPU execution policy claims, normalized exposed
  decoding parameters, stop tokens, response format, tools, tool choice, and
  parallel tool-call policy.
  llama.cpp and picolm text-only chat additionally emit an `effective_prompt`
  digest for the exact rendered chat prompt; text completions emit exact prompt
  digests when the serving backend owns that representation; proxy can emit
  upstream-declared chat and text-completion digests through an explicit opt-in
  endpoint; mistralrs text chat emits a prompt-token-ID digest. Remaining
  opaque multimodal and delegated paths without an explicit digest endpoint
  leave that field absent.

## Baseline Findings

### Model hash enforcement is optional

At the reviewed baseline, `tee_mode = true` did not require `model_hashes` or
model signatures. Startup only called `verify_all_models` when the map was
non-empty, and model load only rechecked models that appeared in the map.

Risk: a production deployment can expose `/v1/attestation` while serving a model
that has no pinned integrity policy.

### `/v1/attestation` can bind stale or missing model state

At the reviewed baseline, `GET /v1/attestation?model=...` used
`config.model_hashes[model]` when present, falling back to `manifest.sha256`.
It did not re-hash the loaded file or the in-memory model buffer on the
attestation request path.

If the selected hash was empty or invalid, the baseline code could silently omit the
model binding instead of failing the request.

Risk: a verifier may accept registration-time metadata as runtime model state.

### Launch measurement does not include model weights

SEV-SNP and TDX launch measurements cover the guest image and boot-time state,
not model files read from disk after boot.

Risk: the post-boot model integrity chain must be explicit, mandatory in
production policy, and reflected in the attestation claims.

### Encrypted model hash semantics are ambiguous

Power supports encrypted `.enc` models and multiple decryption modes, but the
reviewed baseline did not explicitly type the attested "model hash" as
ciphertext hash, plaintext hash, or a composite claim.

There was also an implementation gap to address: in the reviewed baseline,
`MemoryDecryptedModel` and `LayerStreamingDecryptedModel` were stored in
`AppState`, but the backend `load()` interface still received a `ModelManifest`
path and backends loaded from that path. Current remediation adds an explicit
locked-memory backend load path; `picolm` consumes `MemoryDecryptedModel`
plaintext and `LayerStreamingDecryptedModel` plaintext for GGUF models, and
unsupported backends fail closed.

Risk: different paths can hash or serve different bytes if a backend mode does
not explicitly declare which plaintext source it consumes. The current backend
trait therefore requires explicit support for each decrypted plaintext source.

### Hardware signature verification is optional

`VerifyOptions.hardware_verifier` is optional and the verification CLI currently
uses `None`, reporting a skipped hardware signature check as an otherwise
successful attestation.

Risk: integrators can accidentally deploy an offline or partial verifier as if
it were a production verifier.

### Simulated TEE can pass unless policy rejects it

At the reviewed baseline, `A3S_TEE_SIMULATE=1` enabled simulated reports. The
default policy allowlist was empty, which meant all TEE types were accepted
unless strict policy was explicitly enabled.

Risk: development evidence can be accepted in production.

### CPU and NVIDIA GPU evidence are not bound

Power supports NVIDIA CUDA execution paths, and NVIDIA GPU support is a
production requirement. However, the current `report_data` layout is only
`[nonce(32)][model_hash(32)]` and there is no NVIDIA GPU confidential-computing
evidence or NRAS verdict hash in the CPU TEE report.

Risk: CPU TEE evidence and GPU confidential-computing evidence can be checked as
separate statements without cryptographic proof that they describe the same
computation.

### Runtime prompt policy is outside attested claims

Chat templates, system prompts, stop sequences, and sampling parameters affect
the computation but are not included in the attestation payload or a request
receipt.

Risk: "the model ran" does not imply "the model ran with the verifier's intended
prompt construction and decoding policy."

## Remediation Requirements

1. Production verification must fail closed.
2. A missing, malformed, stale, or unverified model digest must fail the
   attestation request.
3. Every attested digest must state exactly what bytes it covers.
4. Simulated TEE evidence must be rejected by default outside explicit
   development mode.
5. Hardware signature verification must be mandatory for production verifier
   paths.
6. NVIDIA GPU confidential-computing evidence must be represented and bound to
   the CPU TEE evidence before Power claims a unified CPU/GPU attestation chain.
7. Runtime prompt construction and decoding policy must be hashable, stable, and
   available to verifiers.
8. Documentation must distinguish development, CPU-only TEE, CPU TEE plus
   ordinary CUDA, and CPU TEE plus NVIDIA confidential GPU modes.

## Implementation Plan

### Phase 0: Coordination and disclosure tracking

Deliverables:

- Open a private security advisory or private issue tracking the disclosure.
- Acknowledge the findings and maintain a coordinated disclosure timeline.
- Add this plan to the repository as the working remediation checklist.

Acceptance:

- The advisory or internal issue references every finding from the report.
- The public docs are not changed to overclaim before fixes land.

### Phase 1: Strict production policy

Code changes:

- Add an explicit `attestation_policy` or `tee_policy_mode` config with values
  such as `development`, `strict`, and `gpu-confidential`.
- In `strict` and `gpu-confidential` modes, reject:
  - empty `model_hashes` or missing model signatures for local models;
  - `tee_type = "simulated"`;
  - missing, malformed, or non-48-byte expected measurements for the detected
    hardware TEE type;
  - remote proxy models unless they have a separate declared trust mode.
- Make `A3S_POWER_TEE_STRICT=1` map to strict policy, but do not make
  environment variables the only way to get safe behavior.

Tests:

- Server startup fails when `tee_mode = true` and strict policy has no pinned
  local model digest.
- Server startup fails for `A3S_TEE_SIMULATE=1` under strict policy.
- Existing development tests still pass when policy is explicitly development.

### Phase 2: Model digest source of truth

Code changes:

- Introduce typed digest claims:
  - `ModelDigestKind::PlaintextWeightsSha256`
  - `ModelDigestKind::CiphertextArtifactSha256`
  - `ModelDigestKind::DirectoryManifestSha256`
  - `ModelDigestKind::RemoteUnattested`
- Add a canonical model claim builder that computes the digest from the loaded
  artifact or verified decrypted buffer.
- Make `/v1/attestation?model=...` fail if it cannot produce a valid typed
  32-byte digest claim.
- Remove silent `decode_hex_nonce(...).ok()` downgrade behavior.
- For HuggingFace directory models, add a deterministic directory manifest hash
  over file paths, file modes where relevant, sizes, and file SHA-256 values.

Tests:

- `/v1/attestation?model=...` returns an error for empty or malformed hashes.
- Tampering with a model file after registration is detected before issuing an
  attestation claim in strict mode.
- Directory models produce stable hashes independent of directory traversal
  order.

### Phase 3: Encrypted model loading and digest semantics

Code changes:

- Split encrypted model claims into ciphertext and plaintext digests.
- Compute plaintext digest after successful AES-GCM decryption.
- Update backend loading interfaces so in-memory decrypted models can be loaded
  from verified plaintext buffers, not from the encrypted path.
- If a backend cannot consume in-memory plaintext, fail closed rather than
  silently falling back.
- Document which digest verifiers should pin for each deployment mode.

Current status:

- Plaintext and ciphertext encrypted-model digest claims are implemented.
- File-backed `DecryptedModel` loading remains available for file-based
  backends.
- Backend trait/source changes for verified plaintext buffers are implemented.
  `in_memory_decrypt` loads GGUF plaintext through `picolm` locked-memory
  loading; unsupported backends fail closed before backend load.
- `streaming_decrypt` loads GGUF plaintext through `picolm` from
  `LayerStreamingDecryptedModel`; unsupported backends fail closed before
  backend load. The current AES-GCM artifact format is still a single
  non-seekable ciphertext, so the decrypted plaintext remains locked in RAM
  while the handle is live.

Tests:

- `.enc + in_memory_decrypt` loads from decrypted bytes on a supporting backend
  and fails before backend load on unsupported backends.
- `.enc + streaming_decrypt` loads a real encrypted synthetic GGUF through
  `picolm`, verifies the plaintext digest pin, does not materialize a `.dec`
  file, and runs chat from the decrypted backend-owned source.
- Ciphertext tampering fails during decryption.
- Plaintext digest mismatch fails before attestation.
- File-backed `.dec` mode reports and verifies the same plaintext digest as
  in-memory mode.

### Phase 4: Attestation claim schema v2

Code changes:

- Replace the fixed `[nonce(32)][model_hash(32)]` semantic with a canonical
  `AttestationClaimsV2` JSON or CBOR structure. Initial JSON support is in
  place for model-bound attestations.
- Bind `sha256(canonical_claims_v2)` into CPU TEE `report_data`. Initial
  binding is in place for model-bound attestations.
- Include at minimum:
  - schema version;
  - nonce hash or nonce bytes;
  - tee type;
  - model digest kind and digest;
  - encrypted artifact digest, when applicable;
  - launch measurement;
  - runtime policy mode;
  - chat template hash, when known at model load time;
  - decoding policy hash, when tied to a request receipt;
  - GPU evidence hash, when GPU confidential mode is active.
- Preserve backward-compatible verification for legacy reports but mark legacy
  binding as development or compatibility only. Verifier compatibility is in
  place: legacy reports use the old offsets, v2 reports verify claims first.

Tests:

- Canonical claim serialization is deterministic.
- CPU report data equals the claim digest.
- Typed model digest claims reject inconsistent plaintext/ciphertext/directory
  optional digest fields.
- Verifier rejects reports whose claims do not match CPU `report_data`.
- Legacy reports do not satisfy strict v2 policy.

### Phase 5: Production verifier API and CLI

Code changes:

- Add `verify_report_strict` or a `VerificationPolicy` object that requires:
  - hardware signature verification;
  - nonce verification when policy declares nonce mandatory;
  - model digest verification when policy declares model digest mandatory;
  - launch measurement verification in strict mode;
  - rejection of simulated TEE.
- Make `a3s-power-verify` default to strict verification unless an explicit
  offline/development flag is provided, and require `--expected-measurement`
  in strict mode.
- Add `--hw-cert-cache-ttl-secs` to tune the in-memory AMD KDS / Intel PCS
  certificate cache for long-running verifier processes.
- Add CLI flags for AMD KDS, Intel PCS, and NVIDIA GPU evidence verification
  modes where needed.
- Make skipped checks visible as non-success status in strict mode.

Tests:

- `verify_report_strict` fails when `hardware_verifier` is missing.
- `verify_report_strict` fails when the expected launch measurement is missing.
- `a3s-power-verify` exits non-zero when hardware verification is skipped in
  strict mode or when the launch measurement pin is missing.
- Simulated reports require an explicit development/offline flag.

### Phase 6: NVIDIA GPU confidential-computing chain

Code changes:

- Added a GPU attestation module with a provider trait, `GpuEvidenceProvider`.
  The compatibility provider consumes configured evidence and NRAS verdict byte
  sources. For nonce-bound attestations, configured verdicts must be parseable
  NVIDIA nvattest/NRAS JSON whose `eat_nonce` matches the CPU attestation
  nonce; stale verdicts fail closed.
- Added `gpu_attestation.source = "nvattest-cli"` to invoke NVIDIA's
  `nvattest` CLI for live GPU evidence collection and NRAS/local attestation.
  The provider passes the same nonce used by the CPU TEE attestation request to
  `nvattest collect-evidence` and `nvattest attest`, then binds SHA-256 digests
  of the raw evidence and verdict JSON. `gpu-confidential` startup requires
  `nvattest_verifier = "remote"` so NVIDIA NRAS performs production evidence
  verification.
- Added `gpu_attestation.source = "nras-rest"` to send configured NVIDIA
  DeviceEvidenceV2 JSON directly to the NVIDIA NRAS REST `/v4/attest/gpu` API.
  The provider requires a 32-byte nonce, GPU architecture (`HOPPER` or
  `BLACKWELL`), and claims version (`2.0` or `3.0`), then binds SHA-256 digests
  of the raw evidence JSON and returned detached EAT JSON.
- Added `GpuEvidenceClaim` with:
  - provider name;
  - evidence and verdict byte-format labels;
  - raw evidence entry count when the provider exposes it;
  - raw evidence digest;
  - verdict digest;
  - nonce linkage through the shared CPU/GPU attestation nonce;
  - structured NVIDIA device claims from `nvattest` verdicts: device type,
    `eat_nonce`, hardware model, UEID/OEM ID, driver/firmware versions,
    measurement result, secure-boot/debug status, and normalized
    validation booleans for nonce match, report signature, FWID match, RIM
    schema validation, RIM signature, RIM version match, and measurement
    availability.
- In `gpu-confidential` policy mode, require a GPU evidence claim and bind its
  evidence/verdict digests into `AttestationClaimsV2`, which is then bound into
  CPU TEE `report_data`.
- In `gpu-confidential` policy mode, `/v1/attestation` rejects missing or
  non-32-byte nonce values so CPU TEE evidence and NVIDIA GPU evidence share
  one 32-byte freshness value.
- In `gpu-confidential` policy mode, startup rejects CPU-only execution policy
  (`gpu.gpu_layers = 0`) after GPU auto-configuration. Use `strict` mode for
  CPU-only TEE deployments.
- In `gpu-confidential` policy mode, startup rejects custom NVIDIA NRAS, RIM,
  and OCSP URLs that are not HTTPS for live `nvattest-cli`; direct `nras-rest`
  also rejects custom NRAS URLs that are not HTTPS. Both startup validation and
  the direct NRAS REST provider reject embedded URL credentials so bearer tokens
  stay in `nras_bearer_token_env`.
- Make ordinary CUDA acceleration a separate declared mode that does not claim
  GPU confidential-computing guarantees.

Tests:

- `gpu-confidential` policy refuses to start or attest when no GPU evidence
  provider is configured.
- `gpu-confidential` policy refuses to start when GPU execution/offload remains
  disabled.
- `gpu-confidential` policy refuses to start with `nvattest-cli` local
  verification.
- `gpu-confidential` policy refuses to start when a custom NVIDIA NRAS, RIM, or
  OCSP URL uses HTTP instead of HTTPS.
- `gpu-confidential` policy refuses to start when a direct `nras-rest`
  endpoint includes query strings, fragments, embedded credentials, or
  unsupported API-version paths.
- `gpu-confidential` attestation refuses to proceed without a 32-byte nonce.
- The configured evidence provider rejects nonce-bound attestations when the
  configured NVIDIA verdict is stale or not parseable as nvattest/NRAS JSON.
- `nvattest-cli` provider tests simulate the CLI and verify 32-byte nonce
  enforcement and propagation, temporary evidence-file handling,
  evidence/verdict digest binding, structured device-claim extraction,
  bounded child-process output, owner-only temporary evidence-file permissions
  on Unix, and rejection of failed core NVIDIA validation booleans.
- `nras-rest` provider tests verify official request-shape construction,
  evidence normalization, 32-byte nonce enforcement, NRAS verdict digest
  binding, structured device-claim extraction when claims are present, and
  fail-closed config validation, including oversized NRAS response bodies,
  oversized evidence/device-claim/token lists, and malformed detached EAT JWTs.
- Verifier policy `require_gpu_evidence()` now also requires an expected nonce
  and rejects GPU claim nonce mismatches.
- Verifier policy `require_gpu_device_claims()` requires structured NVIDIA
  device claims and validates device nonce, `measres`, `secboot`, `dbgstat`,
  and core NVIDIA validation booleans, including RIM schema validation.
- Verifier `ExpectedGpuEvidence` and `verify_claims_expected_gpu_evidence()`
  pin the GPU evidence provider label, evidence/verdict byte-format labels, and
  raw evidence entry count. The `a3s-power-verify` CLI exposes the same checks
  through `--gpu-provider`, `--gpu-evidence-format`, `--gpu-verdict-format`,
  and `--gpu-evidence-count`.
- Verifier `ExpectedGpuDevices` and `verify_claims_expected_gpu_devices()` pin
  exact GPU/NVSwitch device counts, exact GPU UEID sets, allow-list NVIDIA GPU
  and NVSwitch UEID sets, allow-list NVIDIA GPU/NVSwitch OEM IDs and claims
  schema versions, and allow-list expected GPU/NVSwitch hardware models and
  firmware versions plus GPU driver versions. The `a3s-power-verify` CLI
  exposes the same checks through `--gpu-count`, `--nvswitch-count`,
  `--gpu-claims-version`, `--gpu-ueid`, `--gpu-oemid`, `--gpu-hwmodel`,
  `--gpu-driver-version`, `--gpu-firmware-version`,
  `--nvswitch-claims-version`, `--nvswitch-ueid`, `--nvswitch-oemid`,
  `--nvswitch-hwmodel`, and `--nvswitch-firmware-version`.
- Verifier `VerificationPolicy::gpu_confidential()` and CLI
  `--gpu-confidential` bundle the production NVIDIA GPU CC policy so callers do
  not have to remember each individual GPU evidence, GPU provider/format/count
  pin, 32-byte nonce requirement, structured device-claim, exact GPU topology
  pin, GPU claims-version pin, GPU identity/version pin, required NVSwitch
  identity/version pins when NVSwitch claims are present, secure-boot/debug-state
  check, runtime-policy, and GPU execution/offload requirement.
- CPU report data changes when GPU evidence changes.
- Verifier rejects mismatched CPU claims and GPU evidence.
- Ordinary CUDA mode remains usable but is reported as outside GPU CC
  attestation.

Remaining gap:

- Add a native NRAS SDK client, if needed, so production deployments can choose
  between the current REST provider, `nvattest-cli`, or a vendor SDK binding.

### Phase 7: Runtime receipt for prompts and decoding policy

Current implementation:

- Model-bound `/v1/attestation?model=...` includes `runtime.prompt` digests for
  applied manifest chat template overrides or readable GGUF
  `tokenizer.chat_template` metadata. Manifest system prompts and pre-seeded
  messages are not claimed until an execution path actually injects them into
  inference requests.
- Model-bound attestation does not currently emit
  `runtime.decoding.parameters_sha256` for manifest default generation
  parameters, because the OpenAI-compatible inference path does not apply those
  defaults automatically. Request-level receipts cover the decoding parameters
  that are actually sent on each request.
- Model-bound attestation includes `runtime.execution.gpu_sha256` for the
  canonical GPU execution/offload configuration: `gpu_layers`, `main_gpu`, and
  `tensor_split`.
- Verifiers can pin these digests with
  `VerificationPolicy::require_runtime_policy()` or
  `a3s-power-verify --require-runtime-policy`; GPU execution/offload pins use
  `--gpu-execution-digest`, and the CLI can compute the matching pin with
  `--print-gpu-execution-digest` from `gpu_layers`, `main_gpu`, and
  `tensor_split`.
- `/v1/chat/completions` and `/v1/completions` build an
  `a3s.power.inference-receipt.v2` receipt from prompt-bearing API input,
  model runtime chat-template/GPU execution policy claims, and
  normalized exposed decoding parameters.
- Non-streaming responses return `attestation_receipt` and
  `attestation_receipt_sha256`.
- Streaming responses emit a final receipt event before `[DONE]`; if usage
  reporting is requested or token metrics are suppressed, the same final event
  also carries rounded `usage`.
- Verifiers can check response receipt integrity with
  `verify::verify_receipt_digest()` or `verify::verify_receipt_digest_hex()`.
- Verifiers can reject malformed receipts with
  `verify::verify_receipt_well_formed()`, which checks schema,
  request-type/input-kind pairing, and SHA-256 hex fields before policy
  comparison.
- Verifiers can pin receipt-level request policy with
  `verify::verify_receipt_policy()` / `ExpectedReceipt` or CLI flags for
  receipt model, request type, input digest, request decoding parameters,
  stream-options / stop-token / response-format / tools / tool-choice digests,
  and effective-prompt digest/backend/kind or explicit effective-prompt absence
  for opaque multimodal paths. The lower-level
  `verify::verify_receipt_effective_prompt_digest()` and
  `verify::verify_receipt_effective_prompt_digest_hex()` helpers remain
  available for direct digest-only checks.
- SDK verifiers that still have the original request can use
  `verify::verify_receipt_matches_chat_request()` or
  `verify::verify_receipt_matches_completion_request()` to recompute and compare
  every request-derived receipt field, including exact optional output-policy
  digest presence or absence.
- Verifiers can compare a response receipt against the attested runtime policy
  and optional receipt/effective-prompt digest pins with
  `verify::verify_receipt_against_attestation()`.
- `a3s-power-verify` exposes the same attestation-to-receipt check with
  `--receipt-file`, `--receipt-digest`, receipt policy digest pins,
  `--receipt-chat-request-file`, `--receipt-completion-request-file`, and
  `--effective-prompt-digest`.
- Proxy backends can ask upstreams for an explicit prompt digest before
  inference with `proxy_effective_prompt_digest = true`. For chat, the upstream
  endpoint receives the OpenAI-compatible chat body with `stream = false` and
  returns a `chat.rendered-prompt` SHA-256 claim. For text completions, it
  receives the OpenAI-compatible completion body with `stream = false` and
  returns a `text.prompt` SHA-256 claim. Unsupported endpoints leave
  `effective_prompt` absent unless
  `proxy_effective_prompt_digest_required = true`; malformed digests fail
  closed. Image-bearing proxy chat requests leave `effective_prompt` absent
  unless a future claim type can represent the exact multimodal prompt; when
  the digest endpoint is required, those opaque image-bearing requests fail
  closed instead.
- mistralrs text chat emits `kind = "chat.prompt-token-ids"` with a
  domain-separated SHA-256 over the exact token IDs produced by
  `Model::tokenize(..., add_special_tokens = true, add_generation_prompt =
  true)`, matching the path used before generation. mistralrs vision/multimodal
  requests still leave `effective_prompt` absent because image prefixing and
  multimodal preprocessing are not exposed as a stable rendered-byte claim.

Remaining gap:

- Effective prompt digests are implemented for local deterministic text-only
  chat renderers (llama.cpp and picolm), and for proxy upstreams that implement
  the explicit chat/completion digest endpoint. mistralrs text chat is covered
  by prompt-token-ID digest. llama.cpp, picolm, and mistralrs vision/multimodal
  paths, plus proxy image-bearing chat/completion paths, still leave
  `effective_prompt` absent until they can expose the exact prompt
  representation submitted to the model.

Remaining code changes:

- Extend effective prompt digest support only to backends that can prove the
  exact prompt representation submitted to the model.
- Continue extending the receipt whenever new request-visible decoding controls
  are exposed by the OpenAI-compatible API.
- If manifest system prompts, pre-seeded messages, or default generation
  parameters become execution defaults, apply them in the request path first and
  then add matching runtime-policy claims and receipt tests.

Tests:

- Same request and same template produce identical receipt hashes.
- Changing any sampling or stop-token value changes the receipt hash.
- Changing the attested GPU execution/offload configuration changes the runtime
  policy digest.
- Template override changes the effective prompt-policy or receipt hash for
  backends that expose `effective_prompt`.
- Receipt generation is available for streaming and non-streaming responses.
- llama.cpp, picolm, mistralrs, and proxy image-bearing chat paths keep
  `effective_prompt` absent unless the backend can expose the exact
  post-template multimodal representation.
- Shared image-input detection covers top-level request images, per-message
  image arrays, and OpenAI `image_url` content parts.

### Phase 8: Documentation and release notes

Docs to update:

- `README.md`
- `PLAN.md`
- `docs/supply-chain.md`
- Power docs under `apps/docs/content/docs/en/power/` and
  `apps/docs/content/docs/cn/power/`

Required documentation changes:

- Remove or qualify claims that current default settings prove "which model ran"
  without strict model digest policy.
- Explain legacy attestation versus v2 claim binding.
- Document the difference between:
  - development simulation;
  - CPU-only TEE;
  - CPU TEE plus ordinary CUDA;
  - CPU TEE plus NVIDIA GPU confidential computing.
- Add production configuration examples using strict policy.
- Add verifier examples that fail closed.

Tests:

- Documentation examples compile or run where practical.
- CLI help text matches the strict defaults.

## Suggested Work Order

1. Phase 1 and Phase 2 first. They close the easiest fail-open paths.
2. Phase 5 next, so the verifier and CLI stop producing false confidence.
3. Keep expanding Phase 3 validation when additional encrypted-model artifact
   formats or backends consume decrypted plaintext sources.
4. Phase 4 as the schema migration foundation.
5. Phase 6 for NVIDIA GPU production support.
6. Phase 7 for request-level receipts.
7. Phase 8 continuously, with final documentation updates before release.

## Immediate Patch Targets

- `src/config.rs`: add policy mode and strict validation.
- `src/server/mod.rs`: fail closed during TEE startup under strict policy.
- `src/api/openai/attestation.rs`: replace cached hash fallback with typed
  digest claim builder and fail on invalid model binding.
- `src/tee/attestation.rs`: add v2 claim digest binding.
- `src/verify/mod.rs`: continue evolving strict verification policy toward v2
  claim verification.
- `src/bin/a3s-power-verify.rs`: add production configuration examples and
  operational flags for vendor verifier settings.
- `src/tee/encrypted_model.rs` and backend load interfaces: complete chunked
  decrypted loading semantics.
- GPU attestation module: add native NVIDIA NRAS SDK collection in addition to
  the direct REST and live `nvattest-cli` providers.

## Completion Criteria

The remediation is complete only when all of the following are true:

- Strict TEE mode cannot start without pinned local model integrity policy.
- Simulated reports are rejected unless development mode is explicit.
- `/v1/attestation?model=...` never silently omits model binding.
- Verifiers can prove that CPU `report_data` binds the full canonical claim set.
- Hardware signature verification is required in production verifier paths.
- Encrypted model claims identify plaintext and ciphertext digests precisely.
- NVIDIA GPU confidential-computing evidence is verified and bound into CPU TEE
  evidence in GPU confidential mode.
- Chat template and decoding policy can be independently hashed and verified.
- Documentation no longer overstates legacy or non-strict guarantees.
