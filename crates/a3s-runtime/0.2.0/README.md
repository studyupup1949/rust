## Overview

**A3S Runtime** defines a general execution contract for finite Tasks and
long-running Services. A caller submits an immutable unit generation, a provider
materializes it, and observations show whether provider state has converged with
the requested specification.

Runtime owns provider-neutral lifecycle semantics, capability discovery,
durable unit identity, and idempotent request handling. Scheduling, deployment
workflows, routing, product profiles, and provider-selection policy remain in
their owning applications.

## Features

- **One General Unit Model**: Run finite Tasks and long-running Services through
  the same client and provider interface
- **Immutable Generations**: Bind every operation and observation to a unit ID,
  positive generation, and canonical specification digest
- **Idempotent Lifecycle**: Apply, inspect, stop, and remove units with durable
  request receipts and deterministic conflict detection
- **Structured Capabilities**: Match artifact, isolation, network, mount,
  health, resource, and optional feature requirements before provider dispatch
- **Provider-Neutral Inputs**: Describe processes, artifacts, mounts, secret
  references, resources, networking, health checks, restart policy, and outputs
- **Observed Convergence**: Keep desired specifications separate from provider
  observations, usage, evidence, output artifacts, and failure details
- **Durable Local State**: Persist owner-only records atomically under
  cross-process locks without following symbolic-link state boundaries
- **Logs and Exec**: Expose generation-bound log and exec surfaces only when a
  provider reports the corresponding capability
- **Capability-Driven Conformance**: Always run complete Base and Recovery
  profiles, automatically activate advertised optional profiles, and reject
  missing fixtures, incomplete evidence, or provider inventory leaks

## Runtime Model

### Unit classes

| Class | Lifecycle | Typical work |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `Task` | Finite; converges at `succeeded` | Build, migration, evaluation, backup |
| `Service` | Long-running; converges at `running` and healthy when configured | Application, Agent, MCP server |

`RuntimeUnitSpec` is immutable for a `(unit_id, generation)` pair. Changing any
field requires the next generation. Reusing a generation with different content
fails with `GenerationConflict`; submitting an older generation fails with
`StaleGeneration`.

### Specification

A unit specification includes:

- a digest-bound artifact reference and media type;
- command, arguments, working directory, and environment;
- artifact, volume, and temporary-filesystem mounts;
- provider-resolved secret references and delivery targets;
- network mode, named ports, and transport protocols;
- CPU, memory, process, ephemeral-storage, and optional execution limits;
- isolation level, health probe, restart policy, and Task outputs;
- an optional digest binding caller-owned execution semantics.

All wire records use explicit schema identifiers and reject unknown fields.
`RuntimeUnitSpec` v2 makes the ephemeral-storage quota optional; a provider
needs that resource control only when a specification requests the quota.
Protocol validation occurs before state reservation or provider work.

### Observations

`RuntimeObservation` binds provider state to the exact unit ID, generation,
class, and specification digest. It can carry stable provider identity, health,
resource usage, output artifacts, evidence, attestation, and structured failure.

Terminal observations are immutable. If a previously observed provider resource
cannot be found, inspection records `unknown`; it does not silently report
success or erase the last provider identity.

## Operations

The `RuntimeClient` contract exposes:

| Operation | Semantics |
| --- | --- |
| `capabilities` | Return and validate the provider's structured capabilities |
| `apply` | Create, reattach, or converge one immutable unit generation |
| `inspect` | Return the latest observation or a generation-aware absence |
| `stop` | Stop the active generation without deleting durable identity |
| `remove` | Remove the provider resource and persist an absence tombstone |
| `logs` | Read strictly ordered, cursor-addressed log chunks |
| `exec` | Execute a bounded command against the exact active generation |

Each mutating request carries its own request ID and optional absolute deadline.
An exact retry returns or reconstructs the same logical result. Reusing a
request ID with different content fails with `RequestConflict`. A completed
receipt remains replayable after its original deadline and after later
lifecycle operations; an expired pending request is not redispatched. A
deadline is checked independently before new provider work. On the first exec
reservation, Runtime persists the smaller of `started_at + timeout_ms` and the
optional caller deadline. `RuntimeDriver::exec` receives that effective
absolute deadline in `deadline_at_ms`, and every pending replay receives the
same value, so retrying cannot restart or extend the execution window.

## Capabilities

Providers report supported unit classes, artifact media types, isolation
levels, network modes, mount kinds, health probes, resource controls, and
optional features. `ManagedRuntimeClient` validates the complete specification
against those capabilities before reserving state, so unsupported work cannot
leave a pending record or partially created provider resource.

The registry maps explicit `ProviderId` values to typed factories. It does not
choose a provider, infer login state, or fall back to a default. Callers own that
policy and pass the selected ID to `RuntimeClientRegistry::connect`.

## Durable State

`FileRuntimeStateStore` provides the local durable boundary for a managed
provider integration:

```text
state root/
├── locks/                   # short per-unit record locks
├── operations/              # full-operation cross-process leases
└── units/
    └── <unit-key>/
        ├── record.json      # active unit record
        └── requests/        # one durable receipt per request ID
```

The store uses a SHA-256 storage key derived from the validated unit ID. Records
are written through an owner-only temporary file, synchronized, atomically
published, and followed by a directory sync. State directories, lock files, and
records reject symbolic-link boundaries; Unix permissions are tightened to
`0700` for directories and `0600` for files.

Pending receipts deliberately survive ambiguous transport failures. Retrying
the same apply request dispatches the same durable unit identity so an
idempotent provider driver can discover or converge the existing resource.

## Provider Integration

A provider implements `RuntimeDriver` and reports a stable `ProviderId` through
a `RuntimeProviderFactory`. The driver receives validated specifications and
durable unit records; it never owns request conflict or generation policy.

`ManagedRuntimeClient` composes three replaceable boundaries:

```text
RuntimeClient
    |
    v
ManagedRuntimeClient
    ├── RuntimeStateStore   durable identities and receipts
    ├── RuntimeDriver       provider resource lifecycle
    └── RuntimeClock        deadline and observation time source
```

Provider `apply` must be idempotent for the supplied unit ID and generation.
After an ambiguous acknowledgement, a repeated call must discover or converge
the same resource rather than create another one. A successful generation
handoff must retire all older provider generations and verify that exactly the
current resource remains; interrupted handoffs finish on exact retry.
Provider-specific labels, SDK handles, container fields, and transport details
stay behind the driver.

## Conformance

Production provider repositories should implement `RuntimeConformanceFixture`
and run `verify_runtime_profiles` against real, disposable infrastructure:

```rust,ignore
use a3s_runtime::{verify_runtime_profiles, RuntimeConformanceFixture};

let fixture: &dyn RuntimeConformanceFixture = provider_fixture;
let report = verify_runtime_profiles(client.as_ref(), fixture).await?;
assert_eq!(report.inventory_before, report.inventory_after);
```

The mandatory Base profile covers successful, failed, and timed-out Tasks;
Service apply, inspect, stop, and removal; exact replay; generation conflicts;
and tombstones. Recovery is mandatory for every production provider.
Networking, Mounts, Health, Resources, Logs, Exec, Security, Outputs, and
Evidence activate from reported capabilities. A fixture must return the shared
stable case IDs and capability claims for every activated profile, perform
cleanup even after a failed profile, and prove that its canonical provider
inventory returned to the pre-run baseline.

Profile requirements expand to one case ID per advertised behavior rather than
accepting a generic family-level claim. For example, every reported network
mode, mount kind, health probe, and resource control activates its own
configuration and behavioral cases. `NetworkMode::Service` activates both TCP
and UDP because the current protocol has no narrower transport-protocol
capability. Logs separately require filtering, total order, cursor resume,
same-timestamp handling, limits, explicit rotation gaps, terminal retention,
and bounded large records.

`verify_runtime_provider` remains available as the lower-level successful Task
and Service lifecycle check. It is not, by itself, production certification.
Provider-specific fixtures still own real daemon restart, external deletion,
security, resource-behavior, and destructive cleanup mechanics; the shared
harness owns activation, required case/claim coverage, Base semantics, and the
zero-inventory-delta oracle.

See the [deep test plan](docs/deep-test-plan.md) for the full contract,
durability, real-provider, fault, performance, soak, and A3S OS release gates.

## Architecture

The contract and managed lifecycle are intentionally independent of product and
provider concerns:

```text
caller policy and workflow
          |
          v
provider-neutral Runtime contract
          |
          v
managed durability and validation
          |
          v
provider driver and external runtime
```

See [ADR 0001](docs/adr/0001-general-runtime-contract.md) for the general
ownership model, [ADR 0002](docs/adr/0002-complete-protocol-and-operation-semantics.md)
for the completed protocol and operation semantics, and the
[implementation plan](docs/implementation-plan.md) for the dependency-ordered
delivery tasks.

## Development

Run validation from this crate repository, not from the A3S monorepo root:

```bash
cargo fmt --all --check
cargo test --all-targets
cargo clippy --all-targets -- -D warnings
RUSTDOCFLAGS="-D warnings" cargo doc --no-deps
```

The integration suite covers Task and Service behavior, request and generation
conflicts, ambiguous retry, capability rejection, provider identity,
generation-bound logs and exec, independent deadlines, provider disappearance,
terminal immutability, concurrent file reservations, symbolic-link rejection,
registry behavior, and the exported provider conformance path.
