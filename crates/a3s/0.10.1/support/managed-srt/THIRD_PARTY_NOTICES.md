# Managed Sandbox Support Notices

Official A3S CLI release archives include the following fixed npm packages as
local command-sandbox support:

| Package | Version | License |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `@anthropic-ai/sandbox-runtime` | 0.0.66 | Apache-2.0 |
| `@pondwader/socks5-server` | 1.0.10 | MIT |
| `commander` | 12.1.0 | MIT |
| `node-forge` | 1.4.0 | BSD-3-Clause OR GPL-2.0 |
| `zod` | 3.25.76 | MIT |

The complete license text for each package is preserved in that package's
directory under `node_modules`.

A3S applies a narrow Linux compatibility patch to sandbox-runtime 0.0.66. The
patch orders the runtime's mandatory child-path mounts before A3S's stricter
parent-directory denies, collapses mounts that share a missing ancestor, and
preserves read-only access to the runtime's own seccomp helper when the
surrounding user home is hidden. This prevents Linux sandbox startup failures
without weakening either boundary. The modified file remains under Apache-2.0.
