## [Unreleased]

## [0.7.9] - 2026-07-14

### Changed

- Rebuilt `/goal` as a durable Ultracode goal loop. Setting a goal now creates
  a complete `.a3s/loops/goal-*` Loop Engineering workspace, forces planning
  and goal tracking, runs separate maker/verifier guidance, and continues
  across normal ends and retryable errors until a matching `GoalAchieved`
  arrives. Esc and `/goal clear` invalidate delayed retries immediately, and
  normal Ultracode message-gated planning is restored when the goal closes.
- Aligned fenced Markdown code with Codex-style terminal highlighting: known
  languages retain distinct token colors, unknown languages stay plain, CRLF
  is normalized, and 512 KiB / 10,000-line guardrails avoid render stalls.
- Replaced width-unstable colorful emoji in the transcript, task queue,
  thinking indicator, and `/ide` tree with monochrome terminal-safe marks and
  consistent hair-space padding.
- Reworked `/btw` into an isolated side conversation with cancellation,
  request-safe completion, in-memory answer history, and raw Markdown copy;
  side requests inherit the active model/context but never alter or persist the
  main timeline.
- Made the footer the single owner of live context usage; the composer status
  chip now keeps effort/mode information without duplicating context fill in
  the input border.
- Enabled Core's model-aware rolling compaction for TUI and Code Web sessions.
  Each selected model supplies its actual context window, requests compact
  before overflow, and can compact repeatedly throughout a long-running task.
  Core summaries are written back to each host's durable timeline so later
  turns continue from the latest generation instead of compacting it again.
- Moved model, effort, Ultracode, goal, auth, reload, fork, and clear session
  changes onto an async atomic replacement path. The UI no longer blocks the
  Tokio runtime, failed reconfiguration keeps the old session usable, and
  `/goal` can reliably enter forced-planning Ultracode before its first turn.

## [0.7.8] - 2026-07-09

### Fixed

- Hardened DeepResearch against child-task evidence packaging failures: when a
  delegated research track returns source-backed notes but misses the expected
  metadata shape, the workflow now preserves the cited evidence, normalizes it
  into the recursive summary, and continues to synthesis instead of discarding
  useful sources.
- Prevented failed DeepResearch collection from producing false-success reports:
  if no source-backed evidence was collected, the CLI now materializes a
  transparent fallback draft without asking the model to recover current facts
  from memory.
- Cleaned DeepResearch partial-success reporting so final Markdown/HTML reports
  cite original sources and do not expose internal workflow labels, tool logs,
  metadata-normalization details, or stale fallback evidence.

## [0.7.7] - 2026-07-09

### Changed

- Reworked DeepResearch evidence gathering into a bounded, complexity-driven
  recursive parallel retrieval-summary workflow. Local DynamicWorkflowRuntime
  rounds now derive follow-up searches from prior gaps and contradictions,
  stop early when no useful follow-up remains, and keep OS Runtime tool-call
  fan-out disabled until Function-as-a-Service support is available.
- Scaled DeepResearch workflow budgets by query complexity so narrow questions
  get bounded child steps, tool-call/output limits, and host timeouts, while
  broad research still keeps the long-running recursive budget.

### Fixed

- Sanitized DeepResearch partial `parallel_task` failures before synthesis so
  successful structured evidence is preserved while failed child tasks are
  surfaced as compact caveats instead of raw failure blocks.
- Hardened DeepResearch report boundaries so workflow JSON, tool-card
  transcripts, `.a3s-flow` paths, truncated tool-output artifact notices, and
  raw failure diagnostics are withheld from prompts, fallback drafts, final
  report artifacts, and RemoteUI auto-open validation.
- Removed internal runtime/workflow labels from DeepResearch synthesis and
  repair prompts so reports cite original evidence sources instead of host
  implementation details.
- Added a DeepResearch report-phase tool gate: once evidence collection ends,
  synthesis and repair turns can only write or edit `.a3s/research/**` report
  artifacts, and verified reports can be host-cleaned into a final answer when
  the model's text contains artifact-operation narration.
- Added DeepResearch source-trace validation: when gathered workflow evidence
  contains source URLs or local paths, completed Markdown/HTML reports must cite
  at least one of those sources before RemoteUI can open them as final reports.
- Added host-side DeepResearch report completion: if synthesis produces a clean,
  source-traceable `report.md` but stalls before writing `index.html`, the host
  can materialize the HTML view and still validate it before RemoteUI opens.

## [0.7.6] - 2026-07-08

### Changed

- Made the A3S Code TUI default HITL policy risk-aware: read-only inspection,
  web research, safe git reads, and read-only batch calls can proceed without
  prompting, while writes, state-changing commands, delegated work, and unknown
  tools still require confirmation.

### Fixed

- Denied catastrophic shell patterns such as privilege escalation, destructive
  root/home removals, device writes, and `curl|sh` installer pipelines before
  they reach the approval prompt.
- Stabilized the DeepResearch CLI local workflow e2e test fixture so child
  evidence prompts no longer consume scripted report-synthesis responses.

## [0.7.5] - 2026-07-07

### Fixed

- Updated A3S Code Core to `4.3.1` so DynamicWorkflowRuntime scripts can use
  legacy `ctx.tools.<name>(args)` tool calls without bypassing allow-list,
  call-count, or output-size limits.
- Made `?` DeepResearch choose OS Runtime fan-out adaptively: broad,
  multi-source research can use the signed-in runtime, while concise or
  explicitly local tasks stay on the local dynamic workflow path and no longer
  require RemoteUI evidence.

## [0.7.4] - 2026-07-07

### Fixed

- Fixed A3S Code TUI transcript wrapping so the welcome banner, user bubbles,
  streaming Markdown, thinking text, pasted images, and tool cards render for
  the scrollbar-adjusted viewport width instead of wrapping a second time.
- Restored reliable transcript wheel scrolling and drag-to-copy behavior by
  keeping mouse capture enabled while copying the app-managed selection on mouse
  release with clamped viewport coordinates.
- Ignored terminal key-release events in `a3s-tui` so Windows terminals do not
  replay a single key press as duplicate input.

## [0.7.3] - 2026-07-07

### Fixed

- Published the matching `a3s-tui` crate API used by the CLI so crates.io
  verification can build the released package without relying on local
  workspace patches.
- Made the release workflow fail when crates.io or Homebrew publishing
  credentials are missing instead of reporting a misleading successful release.
- Added a crates.io User-Agent and retry policy to release dependency checks so
  GitHub Actions does not misclassify already published A3S crates as missing.

## [0.7.1] - 2026-07-07

### Fixed

- Changed Agent lifecycle commands to treat an Agent asset as a package
  directory, with `agent.md`/`agent.yaml`/`agent.yml` as the entrypoint only.
- Published Agent assets now upload the whole local package source plus
  generated manifest, config, and runtime-binding metadata instead of only the
  entry definition file.
- Updated non-interactive `a3s code agent ...` examples and resolution logic to
  prefer package paths while retaining entry-file compatibility.

## [0.7.0] - 2026-07-06

### Added

- Added DynamicWorkflowRuntime wiring for deep research and ultracode turns,
  including host-side workflow execution visibility in the TUI.
- Added richer A3S Code asset surfaces for agents, MCP servers, skills, OKF
  packages, workflows, asset resources, lifecycle stages, review, publishing,
  deployment, and runtime activity.
- Added expanded context, memory, and knowledge surfaces, including memory
  lifecycle rendering, knowledge-base panels, OKF management, sleep/context
  consolidation views, and durable loop engineering panels.
- Added mouse support across the slash menu, approvals, model picker, theme
  picker, file picker, plugin panel, effort slider, asset pickers, and top
  process table.
- Added shared TUI chrome for transcript gutters, input, footer status,
  reasoning, tool output, diffs, plans, task queues, subagents, help, panels,
  alerts, dividers, progress, banners, and RemoteUI links.

### Changed

- Reworked the Code TUI around shared `a3s-tui` components and AgentChrome so
  interaction, wrapping, status, and panel rendering are consistent across the
  app.
- Expanded the A3S Code TUI README into a capability guide covering everyday
  workflows, safety, OS/Runtime/RemoteUI behavior, asset development, memory,
  knowledge, and dynamic workflows.
- Hardened runtime tool projection and RemoteUI progressive response handling.
- Improved self-update behavior so Homebrew issues can fall back to direct
  release downloads.

### Fixed

- Scoped confirmation cleanup by tool id and kept confirmation streams draining,
  including resume behavior after pending confirmations.
- Confirmed knowledge-base deletion through the shared TUI confirmation flow.
- Refined footer context meter behavior and top process trend rendering.
