//! Syscall ABI classification for the seccomp-style enforcement probe
//! (AAASM-3631; hardened in AAASM-3872).
//!
//! The `SYSCALL_ALLOWLIST` BPF map is keyed by **x86_64 native** syscall
//! numbers. The `raw_syscalls:sys_enter` tracepoint, however, fires for
//! *every* ABI a task can use on an x86_64 kernel:
//!
//! - **native x86_64** — plain syscall numbers (`read = 0`, `write = 1`, …).
//! - **x32** — the 64-bit handlers invoked with 32-bit pointers; x32 syscall
//!   numbers carry the [`X32_SYSCALL_BIT`] (`__X32_SYSCALL_BIT`, bit 30).
//! - **i386 compat** (`int 0x80` / `ia32`) — an entirely *separate* number
//!   space (`exit = 1`, `fork = 2`, `execve = 11`, …) that overlaps the
//!   x86_64 numbers but means different things.
//!
//! Without an ABI check the allowlist suffers compat-ABI confusion: a compat
//! syscall whose number happens to collide with an allow-listed x86_64 number
//! is wrongly permitted (e.g. i386 `execve = 11` aliases x86_64
//! `munmap = 11`). [`native_syscall_nr`] rejects the *detectable* compat ABI
//! (x32) so only native x86_64 numbers are ever matched against the allowlist;
//! the enforcement probe default-denies everything else.
//!
//! ## Known limitation — i386 `int 0x80`
//!
//! i386 compat syscalls carry **no distinguishing bit** in the tracepoint
//! `id`; disambiguating them from native x86_64 requires reading the task's
//! `TS_COMPAT` thread-info flag (a CO-RE task-struct walk), which is out of
//! scope for this change. See AAASM-3872 for the follow-up. Hosts that do not
//! need 32-bit compat should disable it at the kernel/seccomp layer in the
//! meantime.
