//! Seccomp-style syscall-allowlist enforcement probe (AAASM-3631).
//!
//! Unlike every other probe in this crate — which are observe-only and
//! `return 0` after submitting telemetry — this program ENFORCES: attached at
//! the `raw_syscalls/sys_enter` tracepoint, for any PID present in
//! `PID_FILTER` (the monitored/sandboxed processes) it default-denies any
//! syscall whose number is NOT a key in `SYSCALL_ALLOWLIST`, killing the
//! offending process with `SIGKILL` via `bpf_send_signal`.
//!
//! This is the post-escape kernel-layer second line from the Story's core
//! assumption: even if a sandboxed process escapes the WASM VM, the syscalls
//! it can issue are still confined to the policy-derived allowlist.
//!
//! ## Loading
//!
//! Loaded + attached ONLY through the privileged loader daemon
//! (AAASM-3603/3604); `aa-runtime` holds no `CAP_BPF` (AAASM-3605). The map is
//! populated by the daemon from the policy AST lowering (AAASM-3635).
//!
//! ## Kernel support
//!
//! `bpf_send_signal` requires Linux 5.3+. Unmonitored PIDs (not in
//! `PID_FILTER`) are never inspected, so the probe is a no-op for the rest of
//! the system.
//!
//! ## Descendant confinement (AAASM-3916)
//!
//! Confinement must follow the process family, not just the single launched
//! PID. Without propagation a monitored process could `fork()`/`exec()` a
//! child whose new tgid is absent from `PID_FILTER`, and the guard would
//! early-return for that child — letting it run **unconfined**, defeating the
//! post-escape guarantee. The [`aa_syscall_guard_fork`] tracepoint closes this
//! by copying `PID_FILTER` membership from a monitored parent to each newly
//! forked child at `sched/sched_process_fork`, so the child is confined from
//! its first syscall. The paired [`aa_syscall_guard_exit`] tracepoint reaps a
//! key from `PID_FILTER` at `sched/sched_process_exit` — that tracepoint fires
//! per-thread, so it removes the *exiting thread's own tid* on every thread
//! exit (AAASM-3982). On leader exit (`pid == tgid`) this releases the live
//! process's tgid entry; on a non-leader thread exit it reaps that thread's
//! inert tid key (inserted by fork propagation) while leaving the still-live
//! process's tgid entry intact. Reaping every thread's own key keeps the map
//! (cap 1024) from leaking toward exhaustion — which would make later
//! descendants fail open — and stops a reused pid inheriting stale confinement
//! (AAASM-3921c / AAASM-3982).
//!
//! Note the `SYSCALL_ALLOWLIST` is a single global map keyed by syscall number
//! (not per-PID), so it already applies to every monitored tgid — there is no
//! per-PID allowlist entry to copy, only the `PID_FILTER` membership.
//!
//! ## Best-effort limitations (AAASM-3872)
//!
//! This probe is a *best-effort* second line, not a synchronous syscall
//! firewall:
//!
//! - **Kill-after-syscall race.** Enforcement is `bpf_send_signal(SIGKILL)` at
//!   `sys_enter`. The signal is delivered at the next signal-check point, so
//!   the *offending* syscall still executes once before the task dies — a
//!   single `connect`/`sendto`/`write`/`unlink` can land. A truly synchronous
//!   deny (return `-EPERM` before the handler runs) needs seccomp-BPF or an
//!   LSM `bpf_lsm` hook, which is out of scope here; see AAASM-3872.
//! - **ABI guard (fixed here).** The allowlist is keyed on **native x86_64**
//!   syscall numbers. The x32 compat ABI is now rejected via
//!   [`aa_ebpf_common::abi::native_syscall_nr`] so a compat number cannot
//!   alias an allow-listed native one; i386 `int 0x80` compat remains
//!   undetectable from the tracepoint `id` alone (documented in `abi`).
//! - **Fork-vs-thread (AAASM-3916).** Propagation keys on the fork
//!   tracepoint's `child_pid`. For a real `fork()`/`clone()` of a new process
//!   `child_pid == child_tgid`, so the child tgid is confined. For a new
//!   *thread* (`CLONE_THREAD`) `child_pid` is a new tid while the thread's tgid
//!   equals the already-confined parent tgid — so threads are covered by the
//!   parent's existing membership; the extra tid key is functionally inert
//!   (lookups are by tgid) and is reaped when that thread exits (AAASM-3982), so
//!   it no longer leaks the map. A child that forks *before* the guard observes
//!   the parent (TOCTOU
//!   at attach time) is not covered — attach the guard before launching the
//!   confined process.
