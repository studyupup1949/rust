//! Fan-out channel for [`crate::ops::OpsRegistry`] lifecycle transitions.
//!
//! `OpControlPublisher` is the gateway-side broadcast point that subscribed
//! SDK clients (via `PolicyService::OpControlStream`, AAASM-1653) receive
//! pause / resume / terminate signals on. PR-D ships the channel + handler;
//! PR-H wires the `OpsRegistry` transitions to call `publish` with the
//! matching signal.
//!
//! Implementation: a single `tokio::sync::broadcast` channel. Subscribers
//! filter by `agent_id` themselves, which is cheaper than maintaining a
//! per-agent registry of senders for low-volume signalling (pause / resume
//! / terminate are operator-triggered, not per-action). The trade-off is
//! that every subscriber wakes on every message — acceptable for the
//! expected steady-state of < 100 active agents per gateway.
//!
//! Sequence numbers are assigned by the publisher on `publish()`, starting
//! at 0 on construction. They reset across gateway restarts; SDK consumers
//! treat the value as advisory dedup help, not a cross-publisher ordering
//! guarantee.
