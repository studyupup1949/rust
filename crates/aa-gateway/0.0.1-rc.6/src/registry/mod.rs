//! Agent registry — in-memory agent identity store and lifecycle tracking.
//!
//! This module maintains the set of registered agents, their identity records,
//! credential tokens, and heartbeat state. It is the server-side backing store
//! for the `AgentLifecycleService` gRPC service defined in `proto/agent.proto`.
