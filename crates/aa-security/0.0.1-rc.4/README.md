Owns the credential-detection scanner, redaction primitives, audit-normalization
types, and the canonical policy AST relied on by the trusted enforcement layers
(`aa-runtime`, `aa-gateway`, `aa-proxy`, and the eBPF loader). Deliberately a
**leaf** crate with no `aa-core` dependency, so the shared policy AST is hosted
here without a dependency cycle.
