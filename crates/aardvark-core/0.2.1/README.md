# Aardvark Runtime

Aardvark is an embeddable runtime for executing Python and JavaScript bundles
inside [V8](https://v8.dev/). Python runs through [Pyodide](https://pyodide.org/)
inside the V8 isolate; JavaScript bundles run directly on the same V8 wrapper.
Hosts provide ZIP bundles, staged Pyodide distributions, resource policies, and
the process boundary.

The crate is still experimental. Public APIs, manifests, and runtime semantics
may change, and this is not a production-hardening claim.

## Capabilities

- **Persistent isolates** – Keep Python warm between calls, reuse shared buffers, and avoid remounting bundles unless the code changes.
- **Warm snapshots** – Capture Pyodide state with package overlays and reject reuse when the staged distribution fingerprint changes.
- **Sandbox policies** – Enforce per-invocation budgets for wall time, CPU, heap, filesystem writes, and outbound network hosts.
- **Self-describing bundles** – Ship code, manifest, and dependency hints together as a ZIP; hosts can honour or override the manifest contract at runtime.
- **Structured diagnostics** – Every invocation returns stdout/stderr, exceptions, resource usage, policy violations, queue timing, and reset timing.
- **Runtime pooling** – Amortise startup cost with bundle-aware pools, warmed hosts, and registry caches for repeated bundles.
- **JavaScript runtime** – Run pre-bundled JavaScript modules alongside Python handlers. JavaScript supports the same manifest language selection, JSON/RawCtx invocation paths, shared-buffer output, and network policy path; it does not resolve npm packages or `node_modules`.

## Quick Start (CLI)

The CLI is intended for local smoke tests and debugging; production setups should embed the library directly.

```
cargo run -p aardvark-cli -- assets stage --variant full
PYODIDE_DIST_DIR="$(find .aardvark/pyodide-distributions -maxdepth 1 -type d -name 'aardvark-*-pyodide-v0.29.4-full' | sort | tail -n 1)"
test -n "$PYODIDE_DIST_DIR"
AARDVARK_PYODIDE_DIST_DIR="$PYODIDE_DIST_DIR" \
  cargo run -p aardvark-cli -- \
  --bundle example/numpy_bundle.zip
```

Each example bundle includes `aardvark.manifest.json`, so the CLI can read the
entrypoint and package list from the ZIP. To smoke a larger package set, point
the runtime at the same staged distribution and run another manifest-backed
bundle:

```
AARDVARK_PYODIDE_DIST_DIR="$PYODIDE_DIST_DIR" \
  cargo run -p aardvark-cli -- \
  --bundle example/pandas_numpy_bundle.zip
```

Use `--entrypoint` or `--package` only as local debugging overrides for
manifest-less bundles or one-off experiments. Production bundles should carry
their entrypoint and package requirements in the manifest.

### Preparing [Pyodide](https://pyodide.org/) assets

The runtime never downloads wheels on demand. Package loading uses a staged
Aardvark Pyodide distribution, which combines the upstream Pyodide 0.29.4
release with Aardvark adapter scripts and a manifest containing file hashes plus
a compatibility fingerprint.

Downstream setup tools can stage assets directly from `aardvark-core` without
installing `aardvark-cli`:

```toml
[dependencies]
aardvark-core = { version = "=0.2.1", features = ["pyodide-staging"] }
```

```rust
use aardvark_core::pyodide_distribution::{
    stage_pyodide_distribution, PyodideDistributionStageOptions,
    PyodideDistributionVariant,
};

let report = stage_pyodide_distribution(PyodideDistributionStageOptions {
    variant: PyodideDistributionVariant::Full,
    output_dir,
    archive: None,
    force: true,
})?;
println!("staged {}", report.compatibility_fingerprint);
```

The CLI helper remains available for local development and calls the same
library API:

```
cargo run -p aardvark-cli -- assets stage --variant full
PYODIDE_DIST_DIR="$(find .aardvark/pyodide-distributions -maxdepth 1 -type d -name 'aardvark-*-pyodide-v0.29.4-full' | sort | tail -n 1)"
test -n "$PYODIDE_DIST_DIR"
cargo run -p aardvark-cli -- assets verify "$PYODIDE_DIST_DIR"
```

The `pyodide-staging` feature gates the staging-only normal dependencies used
for download, archive unpacking, temporary workspaces, and feature scanning. The
core crate still embeds minimal Pyodide assets at build time through
`crates/aardvark-core/build.rs`; use `AARDVARK_PYODIDE_ARCHIVE` or
`AARDVARK_PYODIDE_DIR` when builds must avoid fetching the pinned core archive.

Then set `AARDVARK_PYODIDE_DIST_DIR` or configure
`PyRuntimeConfig::with_pyodide_dist_dir(...)` / `set_pyodide_dist_dir(...)`.
The `core` variant is only suitable for scenarios that do not install additional
Pyodide packages.

### Building CLI release binaries

Use the workspace task runner to produce release artefacts for the CLI:

    cargo install cross
    cargo run -p xtask -- release-cli

The task ensures the required Rust targets are installed (`rustup target add …`)
before building. Binaries land in `./dist/` (default targets:
`x86_64-apple-darwin` and `x86_64-unknown-linux-gnu`).

Useful flags:

- `--targets <triple[,triple]>` – override the target list.
- `--out-dir <path>` – choose a different output directory.

Prefer to run the underlying cross-compiles yourself?

    cross build -p aardvark-cli --release --target x86_64-unknown-linux-gnu

## Embedding in Rust

### Quick handler execution with `PythonIsolate`

```rust
use aardvark_core::{
    persistent::{BundleArtifact, BundleHandle, HandlerSession, PythonIsolate},
    ExecutionOutcome, IsolateConfig, PyRuntimeConfig,
};

fn execute(
    bundle_bytes: &[u8],
    pyodide_dist_dir: impl Into<std::path::PathBuf>,
) -> anyhow::Result<ExecutionOutcome> {
    // Parse once; cloning `BundleArtifact` is cheap because entries are shared internally.
    let artifact = BundleArtifact::from_bytes(bundle_bytes)?;

    let mut isolate = PythonIsolate::new(IsolateConfig {
        runtime: PyRuntimeConfig::default().with_pyodide_dist_dir(pyodide_dist_dir),
        ..IsolateConfig::default()
    })?;
    // Optionally pre-load the bundle so imports and package setup happen before the first call.
    let handle = BundleHandle::from_artifact(artifact.clone());
    isolate.load_bundle(&handle)?;

    // Prepare a handler session (reuse it across invocations).
    let handler: HandlerSession = handle.prepare_default_handler();
    Ok(handler.invoke(&mut isolate)?)
}
```

`HandlerSession` exposes `invoke`, `invoke_json`, `invoke_rawctx`, and `invoke_async` adapters. `PythonIsolate` also provides `run_inline_python`/`run_inline_python_with_options` for one-off scripts and exposes the underlying `PyRuntime` when you need low-level control.

### Pooling with `BundlePool`

```rust
use std::sync::Arc;

use aardvark_core::persistent::{
    BundleArtifact, BundlePool, LifecycleHooks, PoolOptions, QueueMode,
};
use aardvark_core::{IsolateConfig, PyRuntimeConfig};

fn pool_example(
    bundle_bytes: &[u8],
    pyodide_dist_dir: impl Into<std::path::PathBuf>,
) -> anyhow::Result<()> {
    let artifact = BundleArtifact::from_bytes(bundle_bytes)?;
    let pool = BundlePool::from_artifact(
        artifact.clone(),
        PoolOptions {
            isolate: IsolateConfig {
                runtime: PyRuntimeConfig::default().with_pyodide_dist_dir(pyodide_dist_dir),
                ..IsolateConfig::default()
            },
            desired_size: 2,
            max_size: 4,
            queue_mode: QueueMode::Block,
            heap_limit_kib: Some(256 * 1024),
            memory_limit_kib: Some(512 * 1024),
            lifecycle_hooks: Some(LifecycleHooks {
                on_isolate_started: Some(Arc::new(|id, _cfg| tracing::debug!(isolate_id = id, "started"))),
                on_isolate_recycled: Some(Arc::new(|id, reason| {
                    tracing::debug!(isolate_id = id, ?reason, "recycled")
                })),
                ..Default::default()
            }),
            ..PoolOptions::default()
        },
    )?;

    let handler = pool.prepare_default_handler()?;

    let outcome = pool.call_default(&handler)?;
    tracing::info!(
        queue_wait_ms = outcome.diagnostics.queue_wait_ms,
        heap_kib = outcome.diagnostics.py_heap_kib,
    );

    let stats = pool.stats();
    tracing::info!(
        invocations = stats.invocations,
        avg_wait_ms = stats.average_queue_wait_ms,
        p95_wait_ms = stats.queue_wait_p95_ms,
        quarantine_events = stats.quarantine_events,
        scaledown_events = stats.scaledown_events,
    );
    Ok(())
}
```

The pool now manages multiple isolates, exposes queue behaviour (`QueueMode` + `max_queue`), and enforces per-isolate heap/RSS guard rails. Lifecycle hooks let hosts observe isolate churn and per-call outcomes without instrumenting the runtime directly.

Need to change concurrency after startup? Call `pool.set_desired_size(new_size)` to pre-warm or shed isolates, or `pool.resize(max_size)` to adjust the upper bound.

### Still need the raw runtime?

`PyRuntime` remains available for hosts that prefer to manage bundles and resets manually. When a bundle has a manifest, construct the runtime from the bundle so profile requirements such as `runtime.pyodide.profile` are applied before the Pyodide isolate starts:

```rust
use aardvark_core::{Bundle, PyRuntime, PyRuntimeConfig};

fn execute_with_runtime(bytes: &[u8]) -> anyhow::Result<()> {
    let bundle = Bundle::from_zip_bytes(bytes)?;
    let mut runtime = PyRuntime::new_for_bundle(PyRuntimeConfig::default(), &bundle)?;
    let (session, _manifest) = runtime.prepare_session_with_manifest(bundle)?;
    let outcome = runtime.run_session(&session)?;
    println!("status: {:?}", outcome.status);
    Ok(())
}
```

### Warm Snapshots

Capture a fully-initialised [Pyodide](https://pyodide.org/) instance (including packages) and reuse it for future runtimes:

```rust
use aardvark_core::{Bundle, PyRuntime, PyRuntimeConfig};

fn build_warm_state(bytes: &[u8]) -> anyhow::Result<(PyRuntimeConfig, Bundle)> {
    let bundle = Bundle::from_zip_bytes(bytes)?;
    let mut config = PyRuntimeConfig::default();
    config.apply_bundle_manifest(bundle.manifest()?.as_ref())?;
    let mut runtime = PyRuntime::new(config.clone())?;
    let (_session, _manifest) = runtime.prepare_session_with_manifest(bundle.clone())?;
    // Optional: run warm-up imports or pre-populate globals here.
    let warm = runtime.capture_warm_state()?;

    config.warm_state = Some(warm);
    Ok((config, bundle))
}
```

Any new runtime (or pool) constructed with that `PyRuntimeConfig` skips the heavy [Pyodide](https://pyodide.org/) bootstrap and restores directly from the warm snapshot. Warm states are tied to the active Pyodide distribution fingerprint; a runtime will reject a warm state captured with a different distribution. Captured warm states carry overlay metadata and normally re-import that overlay on restore. Only use `WarmState::with_overlay_preloaded` or `WarmState::into_overlay_preloaded` when you have already baked the overlay into the snapshot image.

## Benchmarking the runtime

For a quick sanity check of `prepare` versus `run` timings, use the built-in bench example:

```
cargo run -p aardvark-core --example bench_echo -- 100 1024
```

Arguments are `[iterations] [payload_len]` (both optional). The harness warms the runtime, captures a warm snapshot, and prints avg/min/max milliseconds for `prepare`, `run`, and `total`. Use it to correlate host-side measurements with the core runtime.

`docs/api/rust-host.md` expands on persistent isolates, pooling semantics, invocation strategies, and telemetry export. For JavaScript bundles, pass `language = "javascript"` in the manifest or descriptor and ship a self-contained bundle produced by your JS build tool.

For non-Rust hosts, load a Rust `cdylib` that links `aardvark-core` and owns the
host-specific ABI. Start with `docs/api/shared-library-host.md`; the Linux
`rusty_v8` archive rebuild procedure in `docs/dev/linux-v8-shared-archive.md`
is maintainer documentation, not the integration entry point.

## Documentation

- Architecture guidance lives under `docs/architecture/`. Start with `overview.md`, then branch into lifecycle, sandboxing, packages/snapshots, and telemetry. The current feature plan is in `roadmap.md`.
- API reference under `docs/api/` covers the manifest schema, Rust host integration, shared-library host integration, handler contracts, and diagnostics handling with examples.
- Developer onboarding material is available in `docs/dev/` for contributors extending the project.
- Performance notes and benchmark workflow live in `docs/perf/overview.md`.
- The included `Makefile` has helpers (`make perf-all`, `make perf-md`). It
  honours `PYODIDE_DIST_DIR` when wiring up the perf harness.

## Publishing Notes

The core library is published as `aardvark-core`. Before cutting a build:

- Audit the bundled [Pyodide](https://pyodide.org/) version and rebuild snapshots if needed.
- Decide whether to ship the CLI (`aardvark-cli`) alongside or keep it workspace-only.
- Ensure `AARDVARK_PYODIDE_DIST_DIR` points at a verified distribution available on the target system; the crate never downloads wheels at runtime.
- Regenerate the bundle manifest schema if new fields were added.

## Limitations and Open Work

- Windows builds are not supported or tested.
- Shared buffer handles expose zero-copy slices; request an owned copy only if you need to mutate or persist the data.
- JavaScript bundles must be self-contained. The runtime mounts bundled files, but does not resolve npm packages, fetch external scripts, or walk `node_modules`.
- Network sandboxing is allowlist-based per session; there is no per-request override yet.
- Filesystem quota enforcement only covers the `/session` tree.
- Streaming outputs and incremental logs are not available; handlers must return a single payload.
- Warm snapshots are tied to the [Pyodide](https://pyodide.org/) distribution fingerprint used when you captured them; changing the distribution requires baking a new snapshot. When you assemble warm states manually, pass the matching fingerprint and only flag them as `overlay_preloaded` when the overlay was baked into the snapshot.
- Runtime pool cleanup/reset work is synchronous; there is no background reset worker yet.
- API stability is not guaranteed; expect breaking changes while the runtime matures.
