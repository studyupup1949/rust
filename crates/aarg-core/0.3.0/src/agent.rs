//! The agent runtime, extracted from four working LLM features (FR-2.1).
//!
//! This module was not designed up front. Through Phase 1, `ingest`,
//! `jd`, `gap`, and `tailor` each carried the same five-step spine —
//! build a request, `complete` it, strip code fences, parse a lenient
//! wire shape, assemble a typed output — written out longhand four
//! times, with four private copies of `strip_fences`. The `Agent` trait
//! below is that spine, extracted in one diff *after* the duplication
//! proved which parts are genuinely shared:
//!
//! - **Shared (the default `run`)**: request assembly, the LLM call,
//!   fence stripping, parse-or-typed-error with a reply snippet, token
//!   accounting.
//! - **Per-agent (the required methods)**: the system prompt, the reply
//!   budget, how typed input becomes the user message, the wire shape,
//!   the error type, and the deterministic assembly of wire into output.
//!
//! Deliberately *smaller* than the runtime's end state: tools,
//! validation-retry, and tracing arrive later in this phase, each
//! pulled by a concrete consumer — the same rule that delayed this
//! trait until four functions demanded it.
