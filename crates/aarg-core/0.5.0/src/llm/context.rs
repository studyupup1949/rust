//! Prompt-size estimation and the silent-truncation guard the two local
//! providers share.
//!
//! AARG's prompts run roughly 4k-8k tokens (the dataset, the job posting, the
//! never-fabricate instructions), and a truncated prompt is silent evidence
//! loss: the model answers from a partial dataset without saying so, which for
//! a tool whose whole point is not to fabricate is a correctness bug, not a
//! performance one. Ollama in particular clips a prompt that overflows its
//! `num_ctx` window with no error, so a client that only *sets* the window
//! isn't enough — it has to size the window from an estimate of the prompt and
//! then check the server's own token count to confirm nothing was clipped.
//! Both jobs need a rough token estimate, so it lives here, once.

///    that boundary can never overflow the window mid-generation; at or above
///    it, the completion budget no longer fits, and a clip (by a server that
///    trims to `window - num_predict`) or a mid-generation context shift
///    (which drops prompt tokens to make room) can no longer be ruled out.
///    The `HEADROOM` margin is deliberately *not* subtracted here: it was
///    spent at sizing time to absorb the estimate running low, and spending
///    it again at check time would refuse a prompt that tokenized a few
///    percent above its estimate yet provably fits.
///
/// 2. **The half-window clip fingerprint** — Ollama does not trim an
///    oversized prompt to just-fit: it keeps half the window. Probed live
///    (Ollama 0.30.11, llama3.3, a 3218-token prompt): `num_ctx` 512 kept
///    258 tokens, 1024 kept 514, 2048 kept 1026 — `window / 2 + 2` exactly,
///    independent of `num_predict`. A count in that narrow band *and*
///    disagreeing with the estimate by more than 25% either way is a clip;
///    the disagreement condition keeps an honest prompt that happens to be
///    half the window from matching, since chars/4 tracks real counts well
///    inside 25% for prose and errs low (never high) for JSON and CJK.
///
/// [`looks_clamped`] is deliberately *not* a signal here. On some Ollama
/// versions `prompt_eval_count` counts only newly evaluated tokens, so a
/// prefix-cache hit (AARG's adversarial loop resends the same
/// system+dataset+JD prefix every iteration) could report a small count on a
/// healthy response and be refused as clipped. The 0.30.11 probe shows the
/// full count on cache hits, but the guard doesn't bet on that holding
/// across versions; the "server ignored our window" case it covered is
