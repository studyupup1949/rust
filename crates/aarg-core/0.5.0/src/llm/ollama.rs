//! A hand-rolled client for Ollama's native chat API (`/api/chat`).
//!
//! Written directly against the wire format with `reqwest` — no SDK. Ollama's
//! native API differs from the OpenAI dialect in three ways this module owns:
//! the response is NDJSON (one JSON object per line, no `data:` prefix, no
//! `[DONE]`), tool-call arguments arrive as a JSON *object* rather than an
//! encoded string, and images ride in a message-level `images` array.
//!
//! The `num_ctx` option matters more than it looks. AARG's prompts run roughly
//! 4k-8k tokens, and Ollama silently clips a prompt that overflows the window —
//! no error, HTTP 200, and (probed live on 0.30.11) only `num_ctx / 2 + 2`
//! prompt tokens kept: a 3218-token prompt came back as 258 processed tokens
//! under a 512-token window, 514 under 1024, 1026 under 2048. Without an
//! explicit `num_ctx` the window is the model default (as small as 4096), so
//! half of a typical AARG prompt would vanish. For a tool built on never
//! fabricating from the dataset that is evidence loss, so this client guards
//! it twice: before sending, it sizes `num_ctx` from an estimate of the
//! prompt and verifies the request fits the model's own maximum context
//! length (from `/api/show`, cached per model) so the server can't quietly
//! cap the window below what was asked; after the response, it checks the
//! server's reported token count for the clip shapes
//! (see [`crate::llm::context`]).
//!
//! One counter caveat, probed the same way: `prompt_eval_count` on 0.30.11
//! reports the full prompt even when the prefix KV cache is hit (three
//! repeats of a shared-prefix request all reported the full size while
//! `prompt_eval_duration` collapsed from 6.97s to 0.10s), but other versions
//! have reported only newly evaluated tokens. The post-check therefore never
//! treats a low count alone as a clip — a cached healthy response must not
//! be refused.
//!
//! The same `/api/show` lookup also reports the model's capabilities, and
//! when they include `thinking` this client sends `"think": false` with every
//! request (see [`ModelFacts`]): aarg wants answers, not a chain of thought
//! it would throw away, and a thinking model left free to think can burn its
//! whole reply budget before producing any visible text.
