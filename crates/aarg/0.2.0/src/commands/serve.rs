//! `aarg serve` — the HTTP companion server for a browser UI.
//!
//! The wasm build (`crates/aarg-wasm`) runs AARG's whole domain pipeline in
//! the browser, but four things a browser page genuinely cannot do stay on
//! this side of a localhost socket:
//!
//! 1. **Hold the API key.** The key lives in the OS keychain; a page can't
//!    read it, and shipping it to JS would leak it. `POST /api/llm` proxies a
//!    single completion through the same credential resolution the CLI uses.
//! 2. **Run typst.** Rendering shells out to the `typst` binary, which wasm
//!    has no way to invoke. `POST /api/render` stages a payload + template and
//!    returns the PDF bytes.
//! 3. **Read/write the workspace.** The dataset and past builds are on disk.
//!    `/api/dataset` and `/api/builds/...` read and write them.
//! 4. **Fetch a cross-origin JD.** A browser can't fetch a Greenhouse/Lever
//!    posting (CORS); `POST /api/fetch-jd` does it server-side.
//!
//! **Hand-rolled, framework-free.** This is the same portfolio move as the
//! MCP server ([`crate::mcp`]): the wire handling is written directly against
//! `hyper` — no axum/warp/actix — one tokio task per connection, typed errors,
//! and every log line on stderr. `hyper` is already a transitive dependency
//! (via `reqwest`), so promoting it to a direct one adds no new crates.
//!
//! **Security model (v1): same-origin, enforced.** The listener binds
//! `127.0.0.1` and nothing else, so only processes on this machine can reach
//! the socket at all — but a loopback bind alone doesn't stop a *browser*
//! from being tricked into talking to it, so [`handle`] enforces same-origin
//! itself, before any route runs:
//! - **A `Host` allowlist.** Every request's `Host` header must name this
//!   server (`127.0.0.1`/`localhost`, with or without the actual bound
//!   port) or it's rejected with `403`. This is what actually stops DNS
//!   rebinding: an attacker's page served from `attacker.com`, pointed at a
//!   DNS name that resolves to `127.0.0.1`, would otherwise look
//!   same-origin to the browser and same-loopback to us — the `Host` header
//!   is the one thing that still reveals the browser thinks it's talking to
//!   `attacker.com`.
//! - **A `Content-Type` gate on JSON routes.** `POST /api/llm`,
//!   `POST /api/render`, `PUT /api/dataset`, and `POST /api/fetch-jd` all
//!   require `Content-Type: application/json` (a `;charset=` suffix is
//!   fine) or they're rejected with `415`. A cross-origin form or `fetch`
//!   using a "simple" content type (`text/plain`, form-urlencoded,
//!   multipart) is sent by the browser *without* a CORS preflight, so a
//!   handler that happily parsed JSON out of such a body could be driven
//!   blind by any web page the victim has open. Demanding
//!   `application/json` forces a preflight, and since this server sends no
//!   CORS headers back, the preflight fails and the real request never
//!   goes out.
//!
//! Together these close the two holes a bind-only story leaves open: a
//! drive-by cross-origin `POST` (blocked by the content-type gate) and DNS
//! rebinding (blocked by the `Host` check). There is still deliberately no
//! CORS header — the browser app is expected to be served by *this* server
//! (`--dir`), same-origin, so no other web page can read the dataset or
//! spend the key. Broadening beyond localhost is a later slice.
//!
//! **Non-streaming.** `POST /api/llm` waits for the whole completion and
//! returns it in one response; server-sent-events streaming is a later slice.
//!
//! The submodules split the surface the way [`crate::mcp`] does: [`routes`]
//! holds the JSON API handlers (thin adapters over the same library services
//! the CLI commands call), [`statics`] serves the browser app's files.
