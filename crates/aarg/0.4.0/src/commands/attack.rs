//! `aarg attack <build>` (FR-3.7) — re-run the adversarial reviewer on a
//! build's saved draft, without re-tailoring.
//!
//! The reviewer is non-deterministic and reads the *current* dataset, so a
//! second pass is a useful second opinion: after backing a skill or
//! dismissing an objection, attack tells you what the reviewer thinks now —
//! for the cost of one review call, not a full Opus tailor + render loop.
//! It's a read-only re-look: the build's stored report is left untouched.
