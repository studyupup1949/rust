//! AARG — The Adversarial Agentic Resume Generator.
//!
//! This library crate holds everything the `aarg` binary does; `main.rs`
//! is a thin shell that parses arguments and dispatches into here. Keeping
//! the logic in a library makes every module testable with `cargo test`.

// The agent runtime lives in its own crate (the Phase 2 split);
// re-exporting its modules keeps every `crate::agent::...` path in
// this crate working unchanged.
pub use aarg_core::{agent, llm, trace, user};

// The resume-tailoring domain lives in the portable `aarg-domain` crate (the
// wasm split); re-exporting its modules keeps every `crate::tailor::...` /
// `crate::gap::...` path in this crate working unchanged. `dataset` is a local
// shim (it adds on-disk persistence to the re-exported model).
pub use aarg_domain::{
    enrich, gap, guide, jd, keywords, metric, mirror, review, strengthen, summary, tailor, tune,
    variant, verify, voice,
