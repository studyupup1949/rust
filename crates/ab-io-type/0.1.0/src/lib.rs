//! Infrastructure for zero-cost zero-copy serialization/deserialization.
//!
//! <div class="warning">
//! This crate only supports little-endian platforms by design.
//! </div>
//!
//! This crate primarily offers the following:
//! * [`TrivialType`] trait
//! * [`IoType`] trait
//! * metadata describing types implementing the above traits (see [`IoTypeMetadataKind`])
//!
//! [`IoTypeMetadataKind`]: metadata::IoTypeMetadataKind
//!
//! ## `TrivialType`
//! This trait is implemented for a bunch of built-in types and can be derived for custom types that
//! contain them (structs and enums). It represents trivial types, which do not contain
//! uninitialized bytes and are fully represented by their byte representation.
//!
//! What this means is that serialization to bytes can be done by simply casting a pointer to a data
//! structure to an array of bytes. Similarly, deserialization of correctly aligned memory is simply
//! casting of a pointer back to the data structure. The trait provides a few helper methods for
//! dealing with serialization/deserialization.
//!
//! ## `IoType`
//! This trait is implemented for all types that implement [`TrivialType`] and for a few additional
//! custom types that have special properties and are useful for FFI purposes.
//!
//! `IoType` data structures can contain optional values or lists of values of a dynamic size. They
//! are not as composable as `TrivialType` and are usually used as wrappers of the highest level.
//! This is in contrast to `TrivialType` that is always fixed size and can't have optional data.
//!
//! ## Metadata
//!
//! The data structures implementing [`TrivialType`] and [`IoType`] traits have the `METADATA`
//! associated constant (see [`IoTypeMetadataKind`]). This field contains a compact binary
//! representation of the recursive layout of the type, which can then be decoded by the machine for
//! FFI purposes or converted into human-readable format for presentation to the user in a somewhat
//! readable way.
//!
//! The metadata contains both the memory layout and the names of data structures and fields.
//! Metadata can also be compressed into an equivalent layout without field names to shrink the size
//! of the metadata further when human readability is not necessary. Compressed metadata can also
//! be hashed to get a "fingerprint" of the data structure, which may be used to distinguish a
//! compatible FFI interface from an incompatible one based on the data layout, not just the number
//! of bytes.
//!
//! ## Overall
//!
//! These traits are designed for zero-cost zero-copy serialization/deserialization. Any correctly
//! aligned memory (both normal and memory-mapped files with `mmap`) can be interpreted as
//! ready-to-use data structures without even reading them first.
//!
//! Does not require a standard library (`no_std`) or an allocator.

/// # Safety
/// This trait is used for types with memory transmutation capabilities, it must not be relied on
/// with untrusted data. Serializing and deserializing of types that implement this trait is simply

/// implicit padding, unions, or anything similar that might make it unsound to access any bits of
/// the type.
///
/// Helper functions are provided to make casting to/from bytes a bit safer than it would otherwise,
/// but extra care is still needed.
///
/// **Do not implement this trait explicitly!** Use `#[derive(TrivialType)]` instead, which will
/// ensure safety requirements are upheld, or use `VariableBytes` or other provided wrapper types if
/// more flexibility is needed.
///
/// In case of variable state size is needed, create a wrapper struct around `VariableBytes` and
/// implement traits on it by forwarding everything to the inner implementation.
