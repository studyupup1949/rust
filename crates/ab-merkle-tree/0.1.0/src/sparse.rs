//! Sparse Merkle Tree and related data structures.
//!
//! Sparse Merkle Tree is essentially a huge Balanced Merkle Tree, where most of the leaves are
//! empty. By "empty" here we mean `[0u8; 32]`. To optimize proofs and their verification, the
//! hashing function is customized and returns `[0u8; 32]` when both left and right branch are
//! `[0u8; 32]`, otherwise BLAKE3 hash is used like in a Balanced Merkle Tree.
