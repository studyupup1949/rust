//! Composable and generic RISC-V interpreter.
//!
//! This interpreter is designed to work with abstractions from [`ab-riscv-primitives`] crate and is
//! similarly composable with a powerful macro system and trait abstractions over handling of
//! memory, syscalls, etc.
//!
//! [`ab-riscv-primitives`]: ab_riscv_primitives
//!
//! The immediate needs dictate the current set of available instructions and extensions. Consider
//! contributing if you need something not yet available.
//!
//! `ab-riscv-interpreter-compliance-tests` crate in the repository contains complementary
//! compliance tests against <https://github.com/riscv-non-isa/riscv-arch-test> for many
//! instructions from both base ISA and various extensions on top of the tests contained in this
//! crate.
//!
//! Does not require a standard library (`no_std`) or an allocator.
