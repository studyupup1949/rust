//! Composable and generic RISC-V interpreter.
//!
//! This interpreter is designed to work with abstractions from [`ab-riscv-primitives`] crate and is
//! similarly composable with a powerful macro system and trait abstractions over handling of
//! memory, syscalls, etc.
//!
//! [`ab-riscv-primitives`]: ab_riscv_primitives
//!
//! The immediate needs dictate the current set of available instructions and extensions. Consider
//! contributing if you need something not yet available.
//!
//! `ab-riscv-act4-runner` crate in the repository contains a complementary RISC-V Architectural
//! Certification Tests runner for <https://github.com/riscv-non-isa/riscv-arch-test> that ensures
//! correct implementation.
//!
//! Does not require a standard library (`no_std`) or an allocator.
//!
//! ## Supported ISA variants and extensions
//!
//! ISA variants:
//! * RV32I (version 2.1)
//! * RV32E (version 2.0)
//! * RV64I (version 2.1)
//! * RV64E (version 2.0)
//!
//! Extensions:
//! * M (version 2.0)
//! * B (version 1.0.0)
//! * Zba (version 1.0.0)
//! * Zbb (version 1.0.0)
//! * Zbc (version 1.0.0)
//! * Zbkc (version 1.0.0)
//! * Zbs (version 1.0.0)
//! * Zknh (version 1.0.0)
//! * Zicsr (version 2.0)
//! * (experimental) Zve32x (version 1.0.0)
//! * (experimental) Zve64x (version 1.0.0)
//! * (experimental) Zvl*b (version 1.0.0), where `*` is anything allowed by the specification
//!
//! All extensions except experimental pass all relevant RISC-V Architectural Certification Tests
//! (ACTs) using the ACT4 framework.
//!
//! Any permutation of compatible extensions is supported.
//!
//! Experimental extensions are known to have bugs and need more work. They are not tested against
//! ACTs yet.
