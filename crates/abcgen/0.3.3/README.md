# abcgen - Actor's Boilerplate Code Generator
**abcgen** helps you to build Actor object by producing all the boilerplate code needed by this patter, meaning that all the code involved in defining/sending/raceiving/unwrapping messages and managing lifetime of the actor is hidden from user. <br> The user should only focus on the logic of the service that the actor is going to provide.
**abcgen** produces Actor objects that are based on the `async`/`await` syntax and the **tokio** library.
The actor objects generated do not require any scheduler o manager to run, they are standalone and can be used in any (**tokio**) context. 

## The user should provide:
- a struct or enum definition marked with `actor` attribute 
- implement start(...) and shutdown(...) methods for the `actor`
- implement, for the `actor`, a set of methods marked with `message_handler` attribute; these are going to handle the messages that the `actor` can receive.
- optionally, an enum definition marked with `events` attribute to define the events that the `actor` can signal

## The procedural macro will generate:
- implementation of `run(self)` method for the `actor` which will return an ActorProxy
- implementation of message handling logic for the `actor`: 
    - calling the `start(...)` method before entering the `actor`'s loop
    - calling the `shutdown(&mut self)` method after exiting the `actor`'s loop
    - handling of stop signal
    - handling of messages (support replies)
    - handling of tasks (functions that can be enqueued to be invoked in the `actor`'s loop so the can access `&mut Actor`)
- `Actor::invoke(...)` helper method to enqueue a task to be executed in the `actor`'s loop 
- an ActorProxy object that implements all of the methods that were marked with `message_handler` attribute
- a message enum that contains all the messages that the `actor` can receive  (which is not meant to be used directly by the user)

More details can be found in the example below.
