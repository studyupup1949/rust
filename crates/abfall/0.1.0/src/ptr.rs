//! Smart pointer types for GC-managed objects
//!
//! `GcPtr<T>` is a lightweight pointer (pointer-sized, Copy) to a GC object.
//! It does not implement Deref and does not manage root counts.
//!
//! `GcRoot<T>` is a rooted pointer that manages root counts and implements Deref
//! for access to the underlying value. Objects remain alive as long as at least
//! one `GcRoot` exists pointing to them.
