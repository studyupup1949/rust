# first-app — findings from the first real application

Bug reports and footguns discovered while building the first shipped
application on AbstractTUI: `abstractcode-tui` (the AbstractGateway coding-
agent client, ../../../../abstractcode-tui in the AbstractFramework
workspace). Every item here was hit live during that build, reproduced
against the published `abstracttui` 0.1.0, and worked around app-side; each
item records the workaround so the engine fix can delete it.
