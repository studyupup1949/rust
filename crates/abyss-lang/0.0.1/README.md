## **Installation**

You can install AbySS from [crates.io](https://crates.io/crates/abyss-lang) using Cargo:

```bash
cargo install abyss-lang
```

Alternatively, you can install AbySS by cloning the repository and building it locally. `cargo-llvm-cov` is supported for test coverage analysis.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-repository/abyss.git
cd abyss
cargo build
```

For test coverage with `cargo-llvm-cov`, install the tool as follows:

```bash
rustup component add llvm-tools-preview
cargo install cargo-llvm-cov
```

## **Getting Started**

To start using AbySS, you can either enter the interactive interpreter mode or run `.aby` script files.

### **Running the Interpreter**

You can start the AbySS interpreter with the following command:

```bash
abyss cast
```

### **Running Scripts**

To run a `.aby` script file, use the following command:

```bash
abyss invoke <script.aby>
```

### **Formatting Code**

AbySS provides a built-in code formatter that helps maintain consistent code style across your scripts. To format your `.aby` scripts, use the following command:

```bash
abyss align <script.aby>
```

This command automatically formats your code according to the language's style guidelines.

## **Language Syntax**

### **Basic Syntax**

AbySS uses a symbolic and intuitive syntax inspired by magical themes. Below are some of the core elements of the language.

- **Comments**: Comments in AbySS are marked with `//` for single-line comments and `/* */` for multi-line comments.

```abyss
// This is a single-line comment
/*
  This is a multi-line comment
*/
```

### **Types**

AbySS supports the following primitive types:
- **arcana**: Represents integers (e.g., `42`, `-3`).
- **aether**: Represents floating-point numbers (e.g., `3.14`, `-1.0`).
- **rune**: Represents strings (e.g., `"Hello, World"`).
- **omen**: Represents boolean values, with `boon` for `true` and `hex` for `false`.
- **abyss**: Represents the `void` type, indicating no value.

```abyss
forge x: arcana = 10;
forge pi: aether = 3.14;
forge message: rune = "Hello, AbySS";
forge is_active: omen = boon;
```

### **Variable Declaration**

Variables are declared using the `forge` keyword. You must explicitly specify the variable type.

```abyss
forge x: arcana = 42;
forge greeting: rune = "Welcome to AbySS!";
```

To declare mutable variables, use the `morph` keyword with `forge`.

```abyss
forge morph counter: arcana = 10;
counter += 5;
```

### **Conditionals**

In AbySS, you can use the `oracle` construct to handle conditionals. One approach is to define conditions directly within each pattern, allowing for flexible and readable branching logic. This method lets you skip a separate conditional statement and write all conditions within the branches themselves.

#### **Pattern-based Oracle**

```abyss
forge x: arcana = -5;
oracle {
    (x > 0) => unveil("x is positive");
    (x < 0) => unveil("x is negative");
    _ => unveil("x is zero");
};
```

In this example, the conditions are written directly within the patterns. The oracle evaluates each condition in sequence and executes the matching branch. If no specific conditions are met, the default pattern `_` is executed.

#### **Boolean-based Oracle**

Another way to use `oracle` is by explicitly writing a condition as part of the `oracle` expression, which can be evaluated as an `omen` (boolean) value.

```abyss
oracle (x > 0) {
    (boon) => unveil("x is positive");
    (hex) => unveil("x is non-positive");
};
```

Here, the condition `x > 0` is evaluated as `boon` (true) or `hex` (false), and the appropriate branch executes based on this result.

#### **Value-based Oracle**

You can also use expressions or assignments within `oracle` for more complex evaluations.

```abyss
forge y: arcana = 42;
oracle (z = y * 2) {
    (z > 50) => unveil("z is greater than 50");
    (z == 50) => unveil("z equals 50");
    _ => unveil("z is less than 50");
};
```

In this case, `z` is assigned the result of `y * 2`, and the appropriate branch is chosen based on the computed value of `z`.

#### **Multiple Condition-based Oracle**

You can also handle multiple conditions within a single oracle construct, allowing for complex branching based on multiple variables.

```abyss
forge a: arcana = 3;
forge b: arcana = 2;

oracle (a, b) {
    (1, 2) => unveil("a is 1 and b is 2");
    (3, 2) => unveil("a is 3 and b is 2");
    _ => unveil("Other combination");
};
```

In this example, oracle evaluates multiple conditions (a and b) together and executes the corresponding branch based on their values. If no specific conditions are met, the default pattern _ is used.

This flexibility makes `oracle` a powerful tool for creating readable and intuitive branching logic in AbySS.

### **Loops**

In AbySS, loops are managed using the `orbit` keyword. This construct allows for both simple and complex loop structures, with additional control provided by the `resume` and `eject` keywords. Below, we explore a range of use cases for loops in AbySS, from basic to advanced scenarios.

#### **Simple Loop**

The most basic form of a loop in AbySS iterates over a range of values. In this example, the loop iterates from 0 to 5 (exclusive of 5).

```abyss
orbit (i = 0..5) {
    unveil(i);
}
```

This loop prints the numbers from 0 to 4 using the `unveil` function. The `..` operator defines a half-open range, which excludes the upper bound.

#### **Closed Range Loop**

You can create a closed range loop using the `..=` operator, which includes the upper bound in the iteration.

```abyss
orbit (i = 0..=10) {
    unveil(i);
}
```
In this loop, the numbers from 0 to 10 (inclusive) are printed.

#### **Infinite Loop**

By omitting the loop parameters, you can create an infinite loop that runs until a certain condition is met. The loop can be terminated using the `eject` keyword, which breaks the loop when the condition is satisfied.

```abyss
forge morph i: arcana = 0;
orbit {
    oracle (i == 100) {
        (boon) => eject; // Break the loop when i equals 100
    };
    i += 1;
};
unveil(i); // Prints 100 after loop termination
```
This example increments `i` in each iteration until it reaches 100, at which point the loop exits.

#### **Loop with Multiple Parameters**

AbySS allows you to define loops with more than one parameter, making it easier to iterate over multiple ranges simultaneously. Here's an example where two loop variables, `i` and `j`, are defined:

```abyss
orbit(i = 0..3, j = 0..3) {
    unveil(i, " ", j);
}
```

In this loop, `i` and `j` both iterate over the range from 0 to 2, and each pair of values is printed. This pattern is useful when you need to perform operations that depend on two or more varying values simultaneously.

#### **Resume Keyword**

The `resume` keyword allows you to skip the current iteration of a loop and move on to the next iteration. This can be used to control the flow of nested loops.

```abyss
orbit(i = 0..3) {
    orbit(j = 0..3) {
        oracle(i == j) {
            (boon) => resume j; // Skip the iteration when i equals j
        };
        unveil(i, " ", j);
    }
}
```
In this example, the inner loop skips the iteration whenever `i` is equal to `j`.

#### **Eject Keyword**

The `eject` keyword breaks the loop entirely. In nested loops, you can specify which loop to break by passing the loop variable as an argument.

```abyss
orbit(i = 0..3) {
    orbit(j = 0..3) {
        unveil(i, " ", j);
        oracle(i == 2) {
            (boon) => eject i; // Break the outer loop when i equals 2
        };
    }
}
```
Here, the outer loop breaks entirely when `i` equals 2, effectively terminating both the inner and outer loops.

These examples illustrate the flexibility of the `orbit` construct in AbySS, which allows for sophisticated looping patterns with easy-to-read syntax. The ability to control flow with `resume` and `eject` further enhances the language's expressiveness in handling loops.

### **Functions**

Functions in AbySS are currently under development. While the core syntax and design are still being finalized, the general concept involves using the `engrave` keyword to define functions. The specifics, such as parameter passing, return types, and function calls, will be detailed as the feature progresses.

This feature is actively being developed, so stay tuned for updates as AbySS continues to evolve.

### **Input/Output**

For output, AbySS uses the `unveil` function to print values to the console. You can pass multiple variables or expressions as arguments, separated by commas. This allows you to concatenate different elements in the output.

```abyss
unveil("Hello, AbySS");
unveil("x + 42 = ", x + 42);
```

In the example above, the second `unveil` statement prints both the string `"x + 42 = "` and the result of the expression `x + 42` on the same line.
