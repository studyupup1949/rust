## [Unreleased]

## [0.3.1] - 2025-10-12

### Fixed
- Switched `reqwest` to the Rustls TLS backend so CI/release builds no longer rely on system OpenSSL.

## [0.3.0] - 2025-10-12

### Added
- CLI `--provider` flag now exposes explicit `claude-code` and `openai-codex` options.
- Codex provider gracefully retries without `--model` when the CLI reports an unsupported model and logs a warning for visibility.
- Support for overriding the Codex model via CLI flag or configuration when invoking the intelligent parser.

### Changed
- Renamed the CLI-backed providers from `Claude` and `OpenAI` to `Claude Code` and `OpenAI Codex` across the codebase and documentation.
- Updated defaults and documentation to reflect the new provider naming and Codex model selection (`gpt-5`).
- Switched the HTTP client to Rustls-based TLS for portable cross-compilation in release builds.

### Fixed
- Ensured Codex integration tests and documentation match the new provider names and model fallback behaviour.
