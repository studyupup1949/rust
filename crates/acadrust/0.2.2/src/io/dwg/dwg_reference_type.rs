//! DWG handle reference types

//! Handle references in DWG encode both the type of reference (ownership,
//! pointer) and the handle value. The reference type determines the
//! relationship between objects.

/// DWG handle reference type, encoded in the high nibble of the handle header byte.

/// See OpenDesign spec section "Handle References".
