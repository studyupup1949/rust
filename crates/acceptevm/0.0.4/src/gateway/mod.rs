/// ## AcceptEVM
///
/// The payment gateway is designed to be ran on the main thread, all of
/// the functions are non-blocking asynchronous functions. The underlying polling
/// mechanism is offloaded using `tokio::spawn`. All invoices are stored
/// in-memory using an AHashMap. Therefore, it is your responsibility to
/// implement persistency for the invoices if you deem that this is required.
///
/// The payment gateway creates addresses and waits for payments to be made to these addresses.
/// When a deposit is made to the address, the gateway will check the balance and if the balance is
/// greater than or equal to the amount specified in the invoice, the gateway will consider the invoice
/// paid and will transfer the funds to the treasury address. However, due to the uncertainty of the blockchain
/// this transfer could fail. It is therefore important to check if the hash is present in the invoice when
/// receiving the invoice from the receiver.
///
/// If the hash is present, the invoice was successfully transferred to the treasury. If the hash is not present,
/// the invoice was not transferred to the treasury, and you should handle this case accordingly. The invoice will
/// always contain the wallet bytes that were used to create the invoice. You can use these bytes to recover the
/// funds using `alloy::signers::local::PrivateKeySigner::from_bytes()`. It is therefore important to store this
/// wallet in a safe location for either programmatic or manual recovery.
///
/// Example:
/// ```rust
/// use acceptevm::gateway::{PaymentGateway, PaymentGatewayConfiguration, Address, Wei};
///
/// #[tokio::main]
/// async fn main() -> std::result::Result<(), Box<dyn std::error::Error>> {
///     let (sender, _receiver) = tokio::sync::mpsc::unbounded_channel();
