[Algebra of Cause-Effect
Structures](https://link.springer.com/book/10.1007/978-3-030-20461-7)
&mdash; an implementation of the theory.  This is the core library of
the [_Ascesis_](https://github.com/k7f/ascesis) project.

## Installation

In principle, `aces` should build wherever `rustc` and `cargo` runs.
Be aware, though, that the project is very much a WIP.  The main
toolchain used in development is nightly channel of Rust 1.44.

To use `aces` as a library in a Rust project, include these lines in
the `Cargo.toml` file:

```toml
[dependencies]
aces = "0.0.13"
```

See [API documentation](https://docs.rs/aces) for information on
public interface to the library.
