/// Represents the final state of a transaction after it has been explicitly resolved.
///
/// This enum captures whether a [`Transaction<Active>`] was concluded by either committing
/// or canceling it. It wraps the corresponding finalized transaction to preserve context
/// for further inspection or logging if needed.
///
/// This is particularly useful in cases where you want to track or return the outcome of
/// a transaction without immediately discarding the object.
///
/// # Variants
///
/// - `Committed`: The transaction was finalized successfully, and no rollback will occur.
/// - `Canceled`: The transaction was intentionally aborted, and rollback will occur on drop.
///
/// # Example
///
/// ```rust
/// let trx = Transaction::<Active>::new();
/// let final_state = if should_commit {
///     FinalTransactionState::Committed(trx.commit())
/// } else {
///     FinalTransactionState::Canceled(trx.cancel())
/// };
/// ```

///
/// This struct is parameterized over a `TransactionState` which determines its behavior
/// when dropped. If the state indicates rollback (`SHOULD_ROLLBACK = true`) and there are
/// registered operations, the `Drop` implementation will attempt to undo those operations,
/// such as removing created files or directories.
///
/// # Type Parameters
///
/// - `State`: A marker type that implements [`TransactionState`], used to indicate
///   whether the transaction is `Active`, `Committed`, or `Canceled`.
///
/// # Usage
///
/// - Use `Transaction<Active>` when beginning a transaction.
/// - Call `.commit()` to finalize the transaction and prevent rollback.
/// - Call `.cancel()` to finalize the transaction while preserving rollback behavior.
///
/// Rollback operations include:
/// - [`RollbackOperation::RemoveFile`]
/// - [`RollbackOperation::RemoveDir`]
///
/// # Example
///
/// ```rust
/// let mut trx = Transaction::<Active>::new();
/// trx.add_operation(RollbackOperation::RemoveFile("some/path".into()));
/// trx.commit(); // No rollback will happen
/// ```
