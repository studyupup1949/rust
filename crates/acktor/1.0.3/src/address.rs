//! Traits and type definitions for the address of actor model.
//!
//! In the actor model, an [`Address`] is a handle to an actor. It is the only way to interact
//! with an actor since the runtime will take the ownership of the actor itself after it is
//! spawned.
//!
//! This modules defines the [`Address`] type for an actor. It also provides the [`Sender`] trait
//! and a [`Recipient`] type which are alternative ways to organize the addresses of actors.
