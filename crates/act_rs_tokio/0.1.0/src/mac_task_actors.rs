/**

    Generates an async oriented actor to be instantiated within an async runtime context.

    The state type that is provided to the produced spawn method must implement:

    ActorStateAsync

    or

    async fn pre_run_async(&mut sel) -> bool;

    async fn run_async(&mut self) -> bool;

    async fn post_run_async(self);

    directly

    Also tokio::task::JoinHandle and paste::paste must be in module scope.

    The latter is a macro from the [paste crate](https://crates.io/crates/paste).

    Works with version 1.0.15 and above.



    The name of the state type is generated from the provided $actor_type.

    As part of the macro output process "State" is appended to the provided $actor_type macro identity parameter, this type is required by the generated spawn method.
    


    The returned bool values from the pre_run_async and run_async method implementations indicate whether or not the actors execution should proceed.

    The post_run_async method is called regardless.

/**
 * Similar to impl_mac_task_actor, but the produced spawn method takes an actor state builder object instead of the actor state itself.
 * 
 * Requires everything that impl_mac_task_actor does, but also that an actor state builder type with a method "build_async" that returns an optional actor state object share the scope of the macro call.
 * 
 * The actor state builder type name consists of the provided actor type name with "StateBuilder" appended.
 * 
 * Note that if build_async returns a None value then none of the run methods are called (including post_run_async).
