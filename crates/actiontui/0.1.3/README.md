**actiontui** is a terminal dashboard for **GitHub Actions**, built with [Ratatui](https://ratatui.rs). It watches workflow runs across one or many repositories and turns the noise of CI into a single glanceable screen — with live status, run-history dots, ETA estimates for in-flight runs, and desktop notifications (with sound) the moment a workflow turns red or recovers.

It runs two ways: a **one-shot snapshot** printed to your terminal (pipeable, with clickable commit links), or a **live watch mode** — an alt-screen TUI that refreshes in the background where you can re-run a workflow, open its commit, and flip to a **Stats view** charting each repo's star history over time.

Why it exists: checking a dozen repos' Actions tabs by hand is tedious, GitHub's own UI has no cross-repo overview, and its traffic/stats history is thrown away after 14 days. actiontui watches everything at once, notifies you on failures, and persists stats to a local SQLite database so the trend keeps growing. It's a Rust rewrite of a shell tool, rebuilt for a richer terminal experience: animated spinners, colored status badges, and bounded-memory rendering for long-running watches.

## Features

- **Per-workflow table** — latest run per workflow on a branch: status, started/finished (local time), duration, ETA, recent history, and the commit that kicked it off.
- **Recent column** — the last few runs as colored dots: `●` green pass, `●` red fail, `◐` running, `○` other. Spot a flaky workflow at a glance.
- **Clickable commit** — the Commit column shows the latest run's head SHA (red when failing). In one-shot output it's an OSC-8 hyperlink to the commit on GitHub (⌘-click in iTerm2); in watch mode, press `o` to open the selected row's commit.
- **ETA** — for in-progress runs, estimated time remaining based on the most recent successful run's duration (`~3m 10s`), turning red with `+overrun` once it runs long.
- **Watch mode** — a live, alt-screen TUI that refreshes in the background with an animated spinner, a refresh countdown, row selection, and a 6h auto-exit.
- **Workflow detail** (`Enter`) — drill into the selected workflow for a colored duration bar chart of its runs over the last 7 days (green/red by pass/fail), with a summary: run count, pass rate, average and slowest duration.
- **Re-run from the TUI** — select a workflow with `↑`/`↓` and press `r` to re-run it (with a `y`/`n` confirm), via `gh api`. No browser round-trip. The refresh interval is set with `-w SECONDS` / `interval` in config, and tunable live with `+`/`-`.
- **Stats view** (`t`) — per-repo Stars / Forks / Watchers / Issues / PRs with day-over-day deltas, plus a full-width unicode chart of the selected repo's star history. Snapshots are persisted to SQLite (`~/.config/actiontui/stats.db`) so the trend grows over time — far past GitHub's own 14-day traffic window. Launch straight into it with `--stats`.
- **Rate-limit view** (`g`) — every GitHub API quota bucket (core, search, graphql, …) with used/remaining/limit, a per-refresh Δ, and when each resets. Fires a sound alert when the `core` bucket dips below 1000. The `rate_limit` endpoint is free, so polling it costs no quota. Launch straight into it with `--rate`.
- **Aggregate view** — collapse every repo into one table grouped by repo.
- **Notifications** — on a green→red or red→green transition, fires a macOS notification + distinct sound (`Basso` for failure, `Glass` for recovery); degrades to a terminal bell elsewhere. Test the channel any time with `--test-notify` or the `t` key.
- **Efficient** — one page of runs per repo, with latest/recent/commit/ETA all derived client-side. Repos fetched concurrently.

## Install

Requires the [`gh`](https://cli.github.com) CLI authenticated (`gh auth login`) — actiontui pulls its token from `gh auth token`, or from `GH_TOKEN`/`GITHUB_TOKEN`.

```sh
cargo install actiontui
# or from a checkout:
cargo install --path .
```

## Usage

```sh
actiontui                                  # current repo's git remote, main branch
actiontui -b feature-x                     # a specific branch
actiontui -R owner/repo                     # a specific repo
actiontui -R owner/repo1 -R owner/repo2     # multiple repos
actiontui owner/repo1 owner/repo2           # multiple repos (positional)
actiontui -w                                # watch mode (60s refresh)
actiontui -w 30                             # watch mode, 30s refresh
actiontui -a -R r1 -R r2                    # aggregate into a single table
actiontui --no-sound -w                     # visual notifications only
actiontui --test-notify                     # fire a sample notification + sound, then exit
actiontui --stats                           # launch into the repo Stats view
actiontui --rate                            # launch into the API rate-limit view
```

```sh
actiontui -x "Update #" -x "in /."         # hide workflows matching either pattern
```

### Repo resolution

Repos are resolved in this order:

1. `-R`/`--repo` flags and positional args
2. `repos` in `~/.config/actiontui/config.toml`
3. `~/.config/actiontui/repos.conf` — one `owner/repo` per line (`#` comments allowed)
4. the `origin` git remote of the current directory

### Keys (watch mode)

| Key             | Action                                   |
| --------------- | ---------------------------------------- |
| `t`             | toggle the **Stats** view (CI ↔ stats)   |
| `g`             | toggle the **Rate-limit** view (CI ↔ rate) |
| `↑` / `↓` (`k`/`j`) | move the selection                   |
| `Enter`         | drill into the selected workflow's detail chart *(CI view)* |
| `r`             | re-run the workflow — selected row (CI) or the one in detail (`y`/`n` confirm) |
| `o`             | open the selected row's commit in the browser *(CI view)* |
| `+` / `-`       | change the refresh interval on the fly   |
| `R`             | refresh now                              |
| `T`             | fire a test notification + sound         |
| `q` / `Ctrl-C`  | quit (`Esc` leaves an overlay view, else quits) |

## Configuration

`~/.config/actiontui/config.toml` holds defaults (CLI flags override it):

```toml
repos = ["owner/repo1", "owner/repo2"]
branch = "main"
aggregate = true
sound = true
# Hide workflows whose name contains any of these (case-insensitive):
exclude = ["Update #", "in /."]   # drops Dependabot version-update runs
# Launch in watch mode without typing -w:
# watch = true
# interval = 60
```

| Path                                  | Purpose                                       |
| ------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------- |
| `~/.config/actiontui/config.toml`     | defaults (repos, branch, aggregate, exclude…) |
| `~/.config/actiontui/repos.conf`      | alternate repo list (one per line)            |
| `~/.config/actiontui/state.json`      | last-known conclusions (transition detection) |
| `~/.config/actiontui/stats.db`        | SQLite history of repo stats (for the chart)  |

## How it works

For each repo, actiontui fetches one page (100) of workflow runs for the branch, then derives — entirely client-side — the latest run per workflow, the recent-history dots, the head commit, and the ETA (most recent successful run's wall-clock duration). The list of active workflows (used to hide deleted ones) is fetched and cached for ~10 minutes. State transitions are detected by diffing against the persisted `state.json`. The Stats view fetches each repo's metrics and writes a daily snapshot to SQLite, computing deltas against the most recent prior day.

**API cost:** every request is a **conditional request** — actiontui stores each response's `ETag` and replays `If-None-Match`, so when nothing changed GitHub returns `304 Not Modified`, **which does not count against your rate limit**. In steady state (CI idle between refreshes) watch mode costs ~0 quota; you only spend a call when a workflow run actually changes. The **Rate-limit view** (`g`) shows your remaining quota (and `rate_limit` itself is free to poll); `+`/`-` tune the refresh interval.

## Development

```sh
git clone https://github.com/jfarcand/actiontui && cd actiontui
./scripts/setup-hooks.sh    # install pre-commit / commit-msg / pre-push hooks
cargo build
cargo test
```

The hooks (in `.build/hooks`) gate work the way CI does:

- **pre-commit** — every `.rs` file must carry an SPDX header.
- **commit-msg** — max 2 lines, no AI attribution; use a conventional prefix (`feat:`/`fix:`/`docs:`/`ci:`/`chore:`).
- **pre-push** — `cargo fmt --check`, `cargo clippy --all-targets -- -D warnings`, `cargo test`.

Lints are strict (`clippy::all`/`pedantic`/`nursery` at deny, `unwrap`/`expect`/`panic` denied in non-test code). See [`CLAUDE.md`](CLAUDE.md) for the full conventions.

## Releasing

CI (`.github/workflows/ci.yml`) runs fmt + clippy + build + test on every push and PR.

Releases are cut from the **Actions → Release** workflow: pick a version bump (patch/minor/major) and it bumps `Cargo.toml`, updates `CHANGELOG.md`, tags, builds Linux/macOS/Windows binaries, publishes to [crates.io](https://crates.io), and creates the GitHub release with the binaries attached. Requires a repository secret `CARGO_REGISTRY_TOKEN` (a crates.io API token).

## Roadmap

Recently shipped: clickable commit SHA, on-demand notification/sound test, and re-run from the TUI. Ideas under consideration:

- **Re-run only failed jobs** — `rerun-failed-jobs` as an alternate to a full re-run.
- **Branch switcher** — change the inspected branch from within the TUI.
- **Per-workflow drill-in** — expand a row to its recent runs / job list.
