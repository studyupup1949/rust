//! Provides common types, utilities, and core runtime components for the Acton framework.
//!
//! This module serves as an aggregation point for fundamental building blocks shared across
//! the crate and exposed to users via the prelude. It includes components related to system
//! initialization, runtime management, actor interaction, message brokering, and internal
//! type definitions.
//!
//! # Key Re-exported Components:
//!
//! *   [`ActonApp`]: The entry point for initializing the Acton system.
//! *   [`ActorRuntime`]: Represents the active Acton runtime environment, used for managing
//!     top-level actors and system shutdown.
//! *   [`ActorHandle`]: The primary interface for interacting with individual actors (sending
//!     messages, stopping, supervising).
//! *   [`Broker`]: The central publish-subscribe message broker implementation.
//! *   [`Reply`]: A utility struct for creating standard return types for message handlers.
//!
//! Internal types and submodules handle the implementation details for these components.
