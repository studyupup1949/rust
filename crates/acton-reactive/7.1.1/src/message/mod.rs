//! Defines core message structures, addressing, envelopes, and system signals.
//!
//! This module provides the necessary components for actor communication within the
//! Acton framework. It includes types for identifying actors, wrapping messages
//! for transmission, interacting with the message broker, and sending system-level
//! control signals.
//!
//! # Key Components
//!
//! *   [`MessageAddress`]: Represents the unique, addressable endpoint of an actor,
//!     combining its ID (`Ern`) and its inbox channel sender.
//! *   [`OutboundEnvelope`]: A wrapper for messages being sent *from* an actor,
//!     containing routing information like sender and recipient addresses.
//! *   [`BrokerRequest`]: A message wrapper specifically for requests intended to be
//!     broadcast via the system [`Broker`](crate::common::Broker).
//! *   [`BrokerRequestEnvelope`]: A specialized envelope used internally by the broker
//!     to distribute broadcast messages efficiently.
//! *   [`SystemSignal`]: An enum representing control signals used for managing actor
//!     lifecycles (e.g., `Terminate`).
//!
//! Internal submodules handle implementation details like the internal `Envelope`
//! structure used for channel transmission and messages related to broker subscriptions.
