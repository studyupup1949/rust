/// **Scenario:**
/// 1. A `PriceService` actor is created and started. It handles `Pong` messages by replying with `PongResponse(100)`.
/// 2. A `ShoppingCart` actor is created and started. It holds a handle to the `PriceService`.
/// 3. The `ShoppingCart` actor handles `Ping` messages by sending a `Pong` message directly to the `PriceService`.
/// 4. The `ShoppingCart` actor handles `PongResponse` messages (replies from `PriceService`) by asserting the received price is 100.
/// 5. The test triggers the interaction by calling `shopping_cart_context.trigger()` three times, which sends `Ping` messages from the `ShoppingCart` to itself.
/// 6. The runtime is shut down.
///
/// **Verification:**
/// - `ShoppingCart` sends `Pong` to `PriceService`.
/// - `PriceService` receives `Pong` and replies with `PongResponse(100)`.
/// - `ShoppingCart` receives `PongResponse` and the assertion `assert_eq!(price, 100)` passes.
