# Acton Reactive

`acton-reactive` is the main crate of the [Acton Reactive Application Framework](https://github.com/Govcraft/acton-reactive), designed for building reactive, event-driven, and asynchronous systems in Rust.

## Key Features

- **Actor-Based Architecture**: Build systems using actors (actors) that communicate via message passing.
- **Async First**: Built on top of Tokio for highly concurrent and efficient applications.
- **Type-Safe Lifecycle**: Type-state pattern ensures actors follow proper lifecycle transitions.
- **Pub/Sub Messaging**: Built-in broker for topic-based message distribution.
- **Supervision**: Hierarchical actor supervision for fault-tolerant systems.

## Quick Start

```rust
use acton_reactive::prelude::*;

#[acton_message]
struct Greeting {
    name: String,
}

#[acton_actor]
#[derive(Default)]
struct Greeter {
    greetings: usize,
}
```
