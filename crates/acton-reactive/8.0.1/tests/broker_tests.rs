/// Tests the basic publish-subscribe functionality of the `ActorBroker`.

/// **Scenario:**
/// 1. Launch the runtime and get the central broker handle.
/// 2. Create two actors: `Comedian` and `Counter`. The `Counter` is configured with the broker handle.
/// 3. Configure handlers:
///    - `Counter` handles `Pong` (increments count). Asserts count is 1 on stop.
///    - `Comedian` handles `Ping` and `Pong` (increments `funny` count). Asserts `funny` is 2 on stop.
/// 4. Subscribe actors to message types using their handles:
///    - `Counter` subscribes to `Pong`.
///    - `Comedian` subscribes to `Ping` and `Pong`.
/// 5. Start both actors.
/// 6. Broadcast `Ping` and `Pong` messages using the broker handle obtained from the started `Comedian` actor.
/// 7. Shut down the runtime (which stops all actors and triggers `after_stop` handlers).
///
/// **Verification:**
/// - `Comedian` receives `Ping` (funny=1) and `Pong` (funny=2). `after_stop` asserts `funny == 2`.
/// - `Counter` receives `Pong` (count=1). `after_stop` asserts `count == 1`.
