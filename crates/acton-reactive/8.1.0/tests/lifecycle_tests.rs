/// **Scenario:**
/// 1. Launch the runtime.
/// 2. Create a `PoolItem` actor builder.
/// 3. Register an `after_start` handler that logs a message with the actor's ID.
/// 4. Register an `after_stop` handler that logs a message with the actor's ID.
/// 5. Start the actor.
/// 6. Immediately stop the actor.
///
/// **Verification:**
/// - Relies on observing the tracing output to confirm that the log messages from
///   both `after_start` and `after_stop` handlers are printed, indicating they were executed.
