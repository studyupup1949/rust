//! Restart policies for supervised actors.
//!
//! This module provides Erlang/Elixir-style restart policies that describe
//! whether an actor should be restarted when it terminates. The configured
//! policy is carried on the `ChildTerminated` notification delivered to the
//! parent, whose handler evaluates it (via [`RestartPolicy::should_restart`]
//! or `SupervisionStrategy::decide`) when deciding whether to restart the
//! child. The framework itself performs no automatic restarts.
//!
//! # Policies
//!
//! - [`RestartPolicy::Permanent`]: Always restart (except during parent shutdown)
//! - [`RestartPolicy::Temporary`]: Never restart
//! - [`RestartPolicy::Transient`]: Restart only on abnormal termination

/// Describes whether and when an actor should be restarted after termination.
/// The policy is a decision helper: it is delivered to the supervising parent
/// inside a `ChildTerminated` notification, and the parent's handler applies
/// it (via [`RestartPolicy::should_restart`]) when performing restarts
/// manually. These policies follow Erlang/Elixir supervision patterns.

    /// Produced only when the `catch-handler-panics` feature is **disabled**:
    /// the panic unwinds the actor task, is caught at the task boundary, and
    /// the actor terminates abnormally, notifying its parent with this reason.
    /// Panics in message handlers and in the `after_start` / `before_stop`
    /// hooks report this way; a panic during shutdown cleanup (including the
    /// `after_stop` hook) also produces this reason, unless a handler panic
    /// already set one, in which case the original message is preserved. The
    /// parent notification is sent in every case. A panic in `before_start`
    /// instead propagates to the `start()` caller, since the actor task has
    /// not been spawned yet.

    /// With the feature **enabled** (the default), handler panics are caught
    /// and logged at each dispatch site and the actor keeps running, so no
    /// termination occurs and this variant is not produced.
