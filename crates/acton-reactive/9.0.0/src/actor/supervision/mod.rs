//! Supervision of child actors.
//!
//! Every type in this module is re-exported from here, so the public paths
//! [`SupervisionStrategy`] and [`SupervisionDecision`] resolve exactly as they
//! did when this module was a single file.
//!
//! # Layout
//!
//! - [`strategy`] — which children to restart when one terminates
//! - [`registry`] — the value types describing a supervisor's children
//! - [`status`] — what a supervisor publishes about one child
//! - [`escalation`] — what happens once restarting stops working
//! - [`events`] — supervision notifications broadcast over the broker
//! - [`error`] — the errors the subsystem returns
//! - [`plan`] — the pure decision layer the engine carries out
//! - [`spawner`] — how a supervisor recreates a child
//! - [`engine`] — the supervising actor's side of registration

// warning rather than a placeholder. `engine` reaches `ChildSlot` and
// `PendingSlot` through `super::registry::` directly.
