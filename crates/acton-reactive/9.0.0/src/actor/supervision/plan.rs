//! Deciding what to do about a terminated child.
//!
//! This module is the supervision subsystem's decision layer, kept separate
//! from the code that carries the decisions out. Nothing here spawns, stops, or
//! messages an actor; [`evaluate`] and [`plan_restart`] read their inputs and
//! return a description of what should happen. The engine performs it.
//!
//! Splitting it this way means the restart rules — which are where the subtle
//! bugs live — are tested by calling a function and comparing a value, with no
//! runtime, no actors, no timing, and no sleeping.
//!
//! Time is a parameter rather than something read from the clock, so a test can
//! place events days apart without waiting.

/// 1. An expected stop is never read as a failure. This has to come first.

///    inspecting slot state behind this function's back.

///    This is what keeps existing programs behaving exactly as they did:
///    children registered through the legacy `supervise()` path have no
