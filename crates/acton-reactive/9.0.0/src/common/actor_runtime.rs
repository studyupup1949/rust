    /// # What is and is not delivered
    ///
    /// The `Terminate` signal is an ordinary message and joins each actor's FIFO
    /// inbox like any other. An actor handles everything queued ahead of the
    /// signal as normal, and on reaching it closes its inbox and then drains
    /// whatever is queued behind it, as `SystemSignal::Terminate` describes.
    ///
    /// So within a single actor, a chain does reach its end: a handler running
    /// before the signal is dequeued still has an open inbox, so a message it
    /// sends to its own actor lands and is drained. What is dropped is a send
    /// issued *during* the drain, once the inbox is closed - which is exactly
    /// what bounds the drain and stops it running forever.
    ///
    /// Between actors there is no such guarantee in general, because each one
    /// closes its inbox on its own schedule and they are all signalled at once.
    /// A message arriving at an actor that has already begun draining is lost.
    ///
    /// # Broadcasts are flushed first
    ///
    /// Broadcasting is the one cross-actor case this method handles for you.
    /// [`broadcast`](crate::traits::Broadcaster::broadcast) completes when the
    /// broker has the message, not when subscribers do, so broadcasting and then
    /// shutting down would otherwise be a race. Before signalling anything, this
    /// method asks the broker to
    /// [`FlushBroadcasts`](crate::message::FlushBroadcasts); the reply cannot
    /// arrive until every earlier broadcast is sitting in every subscriber's
    /// inbox, so `Terminate` queues behind that work rather than ahead of it.
    ///
    /// The broker is flushed here, not stopped - it is stopped last, so that it
    /// stays available to route whatever actors still emit as they wind down.
    ///
    /// # What still needs a barrier
    ///
    /// Work that has not been *started* by the time this is called cannot be
    /// waited for, since there is nothing yet to flush. In particular a
    /// `before_stop` hook that broadcasts to peers which are also stopping runs
    /// after shutdown has begun, so its audience may already be draining.
    ///
    /// For those cases, establish that the work finished before calling this
    /// method: [`ask`](crate::traits::ActorHandleInterface::ask) the actor at the
    /// end of the chain, which resolves only once it has answered. Stopping one
    /// actor with [`ActorHandle::stop`](crate::common::ActorHandle::stop) while
    /// its audience is still running is the way to have a `before_stop` broadcast
    /// observed.
