//! What a supervisor does once restarting a child has stopped working.
//!
//! `Escalation` shipped in 8.2.0 as public, documented, prelude-exported, and
//! entirely unread: there was no way to set it and nothing consulted it. These
//! tests exist to keep it reachable, so the two policies are told apart by
//! something other than their doc comments.
//!
//! The measurement in every test is what happens to the **supervisor**, because
//! that is the whole difference between the two. What happens to the child is
//! identical either way: it stops being restarted and publishes `Escalated`.
