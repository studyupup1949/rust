//! Cascading shutdown reaches every supervised child.

//! A supervisor decides which children to stop from two views that can
//! legitimately disagree: its own registry, and the `children` map on the handle
//! a `supervise()` call was made through. Each test here covers a case that only
//! one of those two views can see, so a "simplification" to either one alone
//! fails a test rather than silently orphaning a child.
