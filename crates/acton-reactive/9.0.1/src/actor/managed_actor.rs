/// Represents an actor whose lifecycle and message processing are managed by the Acton framework.
///
/// `ManagedActor` acts as a runtime wrapper around user-defined actor logic and state (`Model`).
/// It utilizes a type-state pattern via the `ActorState` generic parameter (e.g., [`Idle`], [`started::Started`])
/// to enforce valid operations during different phases of the actor's lifecycle (configuration vs. active processing).
///
/// The framework handles the underlying task spawning, message reception from the `inbox`,
/// dispatching messages to registered `message_handlers`, executing lifecycle hooks
/// (like `before_start`, `after_stop`), and managing graceful shutdown via the `halt_signal`.
///
/// Users typically interact with `ManagedActor` indirectly through an [`ActorHandle`] after the actor
/// has been started, or directly during the configuration phase (when in the [`Idle`] state)
/// to register message handlers and lifecycle hooks.

/// *   `Model`: The user-defined type containing the actor's state and associated logic. It must
///     implement `Default`, `Send`, `Debug`, and be `'static`. Message handlers and lifecycle
///     hooks operate on an instance of this `Model`.
