//! A supervisor's record of its children.
//!
//! [`SupervisionRegistry`] is owned by the supervising actor and reached only
//! through `&mut self` inside that actor's own task. It is never cloned, never
//! shared and never locked, so the rule "do not hold the registry across an
//! `await`" is enforced by the borrow checker rather than by a lint.
//!
//! Alongside it are the small values the subsystem passes around: which
//! incarnation of a child is current ([`RestartGeneration`]), where a child sits
//! in its supervisor's start order ([`ChildIndex`]), and how long to wait before
//! trying again ([`BackoffDelay`]).
