//! Request/reply support: the machinery behind
//! [`ask`](crate::traits::ActorHandleInterface::ask).
//!
//! # How a reply finds its way home
//!
//! A reply is routed by address, and an address is a channel sender: [`MessageAddress`]
//! pairs an `mpsc::Sender<Envelope>` with an identifier. Every handler registrar builds
//! its reply envelope by swapping the inbound envelope's `recipient` and `reply_to`, so
//! `ctx.reply_envelope().send(..)` always delivers to whatever address the *sender*
//! stamped on the request.
//!
//! `ask` exploits that: it mints a private one-slot channel, stamps the sending half on
//! the request as `reply_to`, and awaits the receiving half. Each call gets its own
//! channel, so correlation is structural — there is no correlation-id map to keep, and
//! two concurrent asks cannot be confused with one another. (The IPC client does keep
//! such a map, because it multiplexes many requests over a single socket. In-process
//! there is nothing to multiplex.)
//!
//! # Why this cannot hang
//!
//! Two mechanisms, layered, because neither covers the other's cases.
//!
//! **Channel closure — precise, and usually immediate.** [`exchange`] drops its own
//! copy of the reply sender *before* awaiting. From that moment the only surviving
//! senders live inside the [`Envelope`] handed to the actor, so when that envelope is
//! dropped every sender disappears at once and the receiver reports end-of-stream
//! rather than waiting. The envelope is dropped on every path that ends without a
//! reply:
//!
//! * the handler returns without replying — the common `Reply::ready()` case;
//! * the actor stops with the request on the far side of the shutdown boundary — a
//!   stopping actor drains what is already queued behind its stop signal, then closes
//!   its inbox, and anything past that point is let go;
//! * the handler panics, under either `catch-handler-panics` regime;
//! * the actor is restarted, which builds a wholly new mailbox and drops the old one.
//!
//! Each of those returns [`AskError::NoReply`] in microseconds, naming what happened.
//! Keeping a second sender alive across the await would silently defeat this, which is
//! what [`exchange`]'s explicit `drop` is there to prevent.
//!
//! **A deadline — the backstop.** Closure cannot help when the reply address is still
//! alive but no reply is coming anyway: an actor wedged in a handler that never
//! returns, a handler that stores its reply envelope and then forgets it, or a caller
//! that deadlocked itself by asking from inside a mutable handler (see the `# Deadlock`
//! section on [`ask`]). Those hold a live sender indefinitely, so only a clock ends
//! them. [`DEFAULT_ASK_TIMEOUT`] bounds every `ask`, matching `IpcClient::request`,
//! which pairs a default deadline with an explicit `_with_timeout` variant.
//!
//! The layering matters: the deadline is a backstop, not the primary mechanism. An
//! `ask` that fails for one of the ordinary reasons above returns promptly and says
//! which one, instead of stalling until a timer expires.
//!
