//! Asking a supervisor to take a child on, or let one go.
//!
//! A supervisor owns its children's records privately, so nothing outside its
//! task can write to them. Registration therefore travels as a message: the
//! caller starts the child, then asks the supervisor to record it, and the
//! supervisor does so on its own task in message order.
//!
//! The same route carries the answer back when a supervisor starts a child
//! itself: the start runs on its own task and reports through
//! [`SupervisedChildStarted`].
//!
//! Every message here is crate-internal and never reaches the prelude. They are
//! intercepted by the actor's message loop before handler dispatch, so a user
//! cannot register a handler for them.
