    ///
    /// * Send instead of asking, and let the reply arrive as an ordinary message — the

    /// * Move the exchange off the message loop: clone the handle into a
    ///   `Reply::pending(async move { .. })` future, or a spawned task, so the loop is
    ///   free to keep processing.
    /// * Ask from outside the actor — from a task, a test, or `main`.
    ///
    /// A caller that deadlocks anyway is released by the deadline rather than stuck
    /// forever, and gets [`AskError::TimedOut`] to say so.
    ///
    /// # How this resolves when no reply comes
    ///
    /// `ask` always finishes. Two mechanisms cover different cases:
    ///
    /// * It holds no reply address of its own while waiting, so the moment the actor
    ///   lets go of the request — returning without replying, stopping, panicking, or
    ///   being restarted — the reply channel closes and the call returns
    ///   [`AskError::NoReply`], in microseconds and naming the situation.
    /// * [`DEFAULT_ASK_TIMEOUT`] backstops the cases that closure cannot see, where the
    ///   reply address is still alive but no answer is coming: a wedged actor, a
    ///   forgotten reply envelope, a self-inflicted deadlock.
    ///
    /// Use [`ask_with_timeout`](Self::ask_with_timeout) for a different bound.
    ///
    /// # Scope
    ///
    /// **One actor, in-process.**
    ///
    /// * *Not the broker.* [`broadcast`](crate::traits::Broadcaster::broadcast) has no
    ///   single replier — zero or many subscribers may answer — so request/reply has no
    ///   meaning over it. `ask` addresses the actor this handle names, and nothing else.
    /// * *Not across a process boundary.* This `ask` routes its reply through an
    ///   in-process channel, so it addresses only actors in this process. To ask an actor
    ///   in another one, name it with `IpcClient::actor` (the `ipc` feature) and `ask`
