//! TLS support using rustls
//!
//! Provides a [`TlsListener`] that wraps a TCP listener with TLS termination,
//! implementing [`axum::serve::Listener`] for seamless integration with axum's server.
//!
//! Credentials reach the listener through a [`TlsConfigSource`], a handle whose
//! contents can be replaced while the listener is running so certificates can be
//! rotated without dropping the socket.
//!
//! # What actually triggers a rotation
//!
//! [`TlsConfigSource::reload`] is the mechanism; something has to call it. Four
//! ways to arrange that, from most to least automatic:
//!
//! - **Poll the files.** Set `reload_interval_secs` on the `[tls]` (or
//!   `[grpc.tls]`) config section. The service then hashes the credential files
//!   on an interval and reloads only when their *contents* change. Nothing to
//!   write; suits any rotation scheme that ends in "the files on disk are
//!   different now", including Kubernetes secret projections and cert-manager.
//! - **Send `SIGHUP`.** Set `reload_on_sighup = true`. One signal reloads every
//!   reloadable source in the process. Suits rotation drivers that already know
//!   when they finished writing and would rather say so than be discovered.
//! - **Register a hook.** `ServiceBuilder::with_tls_reload` hands your callback
//!   a [`TlsReloadHandle`] at serve time, from which you can drive
//!   [`TlsReloadHandle::reload_all`] on whatever schedule or event you like:
//!   a Vault lease renewal, a watch on a ConfigMap, an admin endpoint.
//! - **Hold the source yourself.** `ActonService::tls_config_source` clones the
//!   handle out before `serve()` consumes the service. The most direct route,
//!   and the one with an ordering constraint to get wrong; prefer the hook.
//!
//! Every path converges on the same fail-closed [`TlsConfigSource::reload`]: a
//! rotation that produced unusable credentials leaves the previous ones serving.
//!
//! The two config-driven triggers work identically whether the listener came up
//! through `ServiceBuilder` / `ActonService::serve` or through the plainer
//! [`crate::server::Server::serve`] — both call the same installer, so one
//! config file means one rotation behaviour. The hook and the credential
//! accessors are `ServiceBuilder`-only, since `Server` has no builder to
//! register them on.
