# Actor Hierarchy

Actors in Riker form a hierarchy with each actor addressable by a path.
An actor's place in the hierarchy is determined by the location of its parent.
Let's take a look at what the actor hierarchy looks like immediately after the actor system has started:

```text
riker
└─ user
└─ system
   └─ logger
   └─ sys_events
   └─ dead_letters
   └─ dl_logger
└─ temp
```

We can see that without starting any actors ourselves, there's already a number of actors running.
At the base of the hierarchy is our application which by default is named `riker` unless a name was provided using `SystemBuilder`.

There's then three root actors, `user`, `system` and `temp`. These are guardian actors under which all other actors are created.
Perhaps the most important of these is `user`, since most actors created as part of the application are created in this branch.

If we start an actor using `system.actor_of::<MyActor>("my-actor")` we can see it added under `user`:

```text
my-app
└─ user
   └─ my-actor      <-- our new actor is added
└─ system
   └─ logger
   └─ sys_events
   └─ dead_letters
   └─ dl_logger
└─ temp
```

In this case the newly created `my-actor` has a path of `/user/my-actor`.
Since it was started by using `actor_of` on `ActorSystem` it is considered a top-level actor.

Let's look at how the hierarchy changes when another actor is started, this time from within `/user/my-actor`'s `recv`
method using `Context.actor_of`.

[hierarchy.rs](https://github.com/actors-rs/actors.rs/blob/master/examples/hierarchy.rs)

```rust
use actors_rs::*;
use std::time::Duration;

#[derive(Default)]
struct Child;

impl Actor for Child {
    type Msg = String;

    fn recv(&mut self, _ctx: &Context<Self::Msg>, msg: Self::Msg, _sender: Sender) {
        println!("child got a message {}", msg);
    }
}

#[derive(Default)]
struct MyActor {
    child: Option<ActorRef<String>>,
}

// implement the Actor trait
impl Actor for MyActor {
    type Msg = String;

    fn pre_start(&mut self, ctx: &Context<Self::Msg>) {
        self.child = Some(ctx.actor_of::<Child>("my-child").unwrap());
    }

    fn recv(&mut self, _ctx: &Context<Self::Msg>, msg: Self::Msg, sender: Sender) {
        println!("parent got a message {}", msg);
        self.child.as_ref().unwrap().tell(msg, sender);
    }
}

// start the system and create an actor
fn main() {
    let sys = ActorSystem::new().unwrap();

    let my_actor = sys.actor_of::<MyActor>("my-actor").unwrap();

    my_actor.tell("Hello my actor!".to_string(), None);

    println!("Child not added yet");
    sys.print_tree();

    println!("Child added already");
    std::thread::sleep(Duration::from_millis(500));
    sys.print_tree();
}
```

Here `MyActor` will start another actor, which is also an instance of `MyActor`.

```
my-app
└─ user
   └─ my-actor
      └─ my-child   <-- our new actor is added
└─ system
   └─ logger
   └─ sys_events
   └─ dead_letters
   └─ dl_logger
└─ temp
```

Since the new actor was started using `my-actor`'s context it is added to the hierarchy as a child of `my-actor`. `my-child`'s path becomes `/user/my-actor/my-child`.

Let's move on the next section where we'll look at how the actor hierarchy is used in supervision to build resilient, self healing applications.
