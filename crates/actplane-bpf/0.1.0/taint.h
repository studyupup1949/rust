/*
 * ActPlane in-kernel taint model (full design, see docs/rule-language.md).
 *
 * Taint state is a u64 label set per node (process / file / endpoint). The
 * Rust collector compiles the DSL down to the flat tables below; the kernel
 * propagates labels and evaluates the rules. This header holds the libc/libbpf-
 * free *matching predicates* shared by the eBPF program and the unit tests
 * (test_taint.c); the map-bearing engine is taint_engine.bpf.h.
 *
 * Constructs supported (per rule-language.md):
 *   - object + subject sources                          (struct taint_source)
 *   - sinks with boolean label masks (req AND, forbid NOT) and conditions
 *     (lineage-includes / after / target-scope)         (struct taint_rule)
 *   - declassify / endorse on a gate exec               (struct taint_xform)
 *   - lineage/temporal gates                            (struct taint_gate)
 * Globs are lowered to exact/prefix by the compiler; the kernel matches
 * exact (comm) or prefix (path / IPv4 dotted / host).
