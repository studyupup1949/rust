//! Embedded web runtime assets for `actr run --web`.
//!
//! These files are compiled into the `actr` binary so that `actr run --web`
//! can serve a fully self-contained web actor host without requiring any
//! external runtime WASM files, JS glue, or HTML pages.
//!
//! Assets:
//! - `actr_sw_host_bg.wasm` — shared SW host WASM (wasm-pack from sw-host)
//! - `actr_sw_host.js`      — wasm-bindgen JS glue for the SW host
//! - `actor.sw.js`          — Service Worker entry point (Option U /
//!   wasm-bindgen guest path; sole browser path after Phase 8)
//! - `actr-host.html`       — self-contained host page with inline @actr/dom
