//! DataChunkRegistry - Fast path data stream registry
//!
//! # Dispatch semantics (issue #285 minimal closure)
//!
//! Each `stream_id` gets its own lazily-spawned worker task fed by a bounded
//! mpsc queue. This yields:
//!
//! - **Same stream = FIFO run-to-completion**: chunks of one stream are
//!   delivered to the callback strictly in arrival order, one at a time. The
//!   previous chunk's callback future fully resolves before the next starts.
//! - **Different streams = independent workers**: each stream has its own
//!   worker, so a slow callback on stream A never blocks stream B's callback
//!   *execution*. Enqueue runs in a shared per-class receive task, so under
//!   reliable overload a full stream-A queue can delay stream B's *enqueue*
//!   until A drains — but never its execution, and never RPC.
//! - **Reliable overflow = backpressure**: for `StreamReliable`, a full
//!   per-stream queue makes `dispatch` `await` the bounded send. The stall is
//!   confined to the **stream** receive path: RPC travels on a separate queue
//!   and receive task on both transports (WebRTC's split inbound queues,
//!   WebSocket's per-lane tasks), so stream backpressure can never starve RPC
//!   delivery. On WebRTC the stall cascades through the bounded lane/coordinator
//!   queues to the SCTP data channel's receive window, slowing the peer; it
//!   engages only when the app falls behind by a full queue depth. The callback
//!   still runs on its own worker task; we never inline-await it.
//! - **LatencyFirst overflow = drop**: for `StreamLatencyFirst`, a full queue
//!   drops the newest chunk and bumps `dropped_count`. The wire transport is
//!   already partially-reliable (maxRetransmits), so the app must not rely on
//!   every chunk arriving.
//! - **panic isolation**: a callback panic is caught, counted
//!   (`panic_count`), logged, and the worker continues with the next chunk. A
//!   sibling stream or the receive path is never taken down.
//! - **unregister = drain**: removing a stream drops the stored sender; the
//!   worker drains already-queued chunks then exits (already-accepted chunks are
//!   still delivered, matching reliable "accepted == delivered").
//! - **re-register = immediate swap**: the callback travels with each queued
//!   chunk (cloned at `dispatch` time), so replacing a stream's handler — even
//!   by re-registering the same `stream_id` without unregistering first — takes
//!   effect on the very next dispatched chunk. A worker never pins the callback
//!   it was spawned with, which also makes any residual/racing worker benign:
//!   whichever worker drains a chunk runs the callback the dispatcher captured
//!   for that chunk, never a stale one.
//! - **unregister + re-register = drain first**: if a stream is re-registered
//!   while its previous worker is draining already-accepted chunks, new
//!   dispatches wait for the previous worker to exit before creating a
//!   replacement worker. This preserves the single-worker invariant for the
//!   `stream_id`.
//! - **shutdown = cancel**: `shutdown()` cancels the shared token so workers
//!   drop queued chunks, let any in-flight callback finish, then exit; all
//!   worker handles are joined (with a bounded timeout, else aborted). No
//!   orphan tasks in either path.
//!
//! A worker is never resurrected after its channel closes: once unregistered or
//! shut down, a stream stays gone until explicitly re-registered.
