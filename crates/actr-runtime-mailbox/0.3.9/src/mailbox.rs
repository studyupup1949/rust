//! # Actor Mailbox
//!
//! This module defines the core interfaces and data structures for persistent message queues.
//!
//! ## Reliable Queue Workflow
//!
//! This interface is designed as a reliable queue to prevent message loss when a consumer
//! crashes during message processing. The workflow is as follows:
//!
//! 1.  **`dequeue()`**: The consumer retrieves a batch of messages from the queue. These messages
//!     are atomically marked as `Inflight` in the database, but are **not deleted**.
//! 2.  **Process messages**: The consumer processes these messages locally.
//! 3.  **`ack()`**: When a message has been successfully processed, the consumer calls
//!     `ack(message_id)`. This **permanently deletes** the message, marking the successful
//!     completion of the work unit.
//!
//! If the consumer crashes after `dequeue` but before `ack`, those `Inflight` messages remain
//! in the database. On the next consumer restart, a "cleanup" routine can be implemented to
//! reprocess these "stuck" messages.
