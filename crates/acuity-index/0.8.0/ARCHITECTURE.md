## Overview

`acuity-index` is a config-driven event indexer for Substrate chains. It connects to a node over WebSocket RPC, decodes runtime events with `subxt`, derives query keys from explicit TOML config, stores index entries in `sled`, and exposes read/query access over its own WebSocket API.

The design is intentionally schema-light:

- Chain-specific behavior lives mostly in TOML.
- Event payloads are decoded generically with `scale_value` instead of generated Rust types.
- The on-disk index is append-oriented and keyed by queryable event attributes.

This file is meant to help AI agents quickly find the right code and understand the main invariants before making changes.

## Runtime Components

- `src/main.rs`
  Parses CLI args, loads index spec and options config, opens sled, verifies genesis hash, starts long-lived subscription/WebSocket tasks plus the optional metrics listener, watches the index spec file for accepted changes, and runs a reconnect/supervisor loop that only recreates the RPC clients plus indexer task with exponential backoff on transient failures.
- `src/metrics.rs`
  Owns the in-process `prometheus-client` registry, exposes the optional HTTP `/metrics` endpoint in OpenMetrics text format, and records process-level gauges, counters, and block-stage histograms.
- `src/indexer.rs`
  Owns the indexing pipeline, span tracking, resume logic, live-head tailing, event key derivation, and notification fanout into shared subscriber state. Saves the current span before returning on any error so the supervisor loop can resume without data loss.
- `src/config.rs`
  Defines the TOML schema and resolves configured event params into runtime key-mapping rules.
- `src/websockets.rs`
  Implements the public WebSocket API, request/response handling, connection lifecycle, and optional finalized proof inclusion for `GetEvents` responses.
- `src/shared.rs`
  Holds shared wire types, on-disk key formats, database tree handles, shared runtime state, finalized-mode gating, and common enums like `Key`, `RequestMessage`, and `ResponseMessage`.
- `src/event_hydration.rs`
  Hydrates decoded events for API responses and, when requested, fetches finalized `System.Events` storage proofs keyed by block.
- `src/config_gen.rs`
  Builds starter index spec TOML files from live runtime metadata.
- `src/synthetic_devnet.rs`
  Shared support code for the in-repo synthetic devnet. It renders a synthetic index spec in Rust, polls node/indexer readiness, provides small WebSocket API probe helpers, and defines the manifest/report types shared by the seeder, benchmark harness, and integration tests.
- `src/bin/seed_synthetic_runtime.rs`
  Deterministic chain seeder for the synthetic runtime. It submits known transactions in `smoke` or `bulk` mode and emits a `SeedManifest` describing the expected indexed queries that tests and benchmarks later validate through the public API.
- `src/bin/benchmark_synthetic_indexing.rs`
  End-to-end benchmark harness for the synthetic runtime. It starts `acuity-index` against a rendered synthetic config, waits until the manifest queries are observable through `GetEvents`, and emits a `BenchmarkReport` with throughput and on-disk size metrics.
- `runtime/`
  Separate in-repo Polkadot SDK runtime workspace used for local devnet testing. It builds a WASM runtime consumed by `polkadot-omni-node` and includes the custom `Synthetic` pallet used to exercise indexed key shapes.
- `tests/common/mod.rs`
  Process orchestration helpers for the synthetic integration test. It builds the runtime, generates a chain spec, starts the local node and indexer, can enable libp2p networking plus finalized indexing for proof-oriented flows, runs the seeder, and manages child-process cleanup.
- `tests/synthetic_integration.rs`
  Ignored external integration test that validates the full synthetic stack end to end: runtime build, local node, indexer startup, deterministic seeding, WebSocket API query verification, and finalized event-proof verification.

## Synthetic Devnet Architecture

A self-contained local devnet stack lets the repository test and benchmark the real indexer against a deterministic Substrate chain without depending on external networks.

The stack has five layers:

1. `runtime/` builds a small Polkadot SDK runtime WASM with standard system pallets plus a custom `Synthetic` pallet.
2. `polkadot-omni-node` runs that WASM runtime locally from a generated chain spec.
3. `src/synthetic_devnet.rs` renders the matching index specification for the synthetic pallet events and exposes helper calls for `GetEvents` with or without proofs.
4. `src/bin/seed_synthetic_runtime.rs` writes deterministic on-chain data that should become queryable through the indexer.
5. `acuity-index` indexes that chain normally, and tests/benchmarks validate the result through the public WebSocket API.

This is intentionally close to production architecture. The synthetic setup does not bypass the normal indexer path; it exercises the same RPC, metadata decoding, indexing, sled persistence, and WebSocket query surfaces as a real deployment.

### Synthetic runtime

The in-repo runtime exists to make local validation deterministic and self-contained.

- It is built as a separate Cargo workspace under `runtime/`.
- `runtime/pallets/synthetic` defines a small custom pallet that emits predictable events covering the key shapes the indexer needs to exercise locally: `u32`, `bytes32`, `account_id`, and repeated multi-value fields.
- `src/synthetic_devnet.rs` renders those event shapes as index rules so the indexer can query the seeded data through normal custom-key and built-in-key lookups.

The runtime keeps a small pallet set on purpose. The custom `Synthetic` pallet provides deterministic event-heavy workloads for integration tests and benchmarks.

### Synthetic config generation

The synthetic index spec is generated at runtime rather than checked in as a static file.

- `src/synthetic_devnet.rs` renders the current `genesis_hash` plus `default_url` for the currently running local node.
- Tests and benchmark tooling write that rendered config into a temporary working directory before launching `acuity-index`.

This keeps the synthetic workflow safe for disposable local chains whose genesis hash is only known after the chain spec/runtime is materialized.

### Synthetic Node Modes

The synthetic tooling currently uses multiple local-node modes.

- `just synthetic-node` runs `polkadot-omni-node` in dev mode with `--instant-seal --pool-type single-state` for interactive local experimentation and smoke-style seeding.
- `just benchmark-indexing` starts its own disposable dev node with `--dev-block-time 50 --pool-type single-state` and deliberately does not use `--instant-seal`.
- finalized proof tests start a libp2p-enabled local node instead of instant-seal dev mode so a local light-client-compatible networking path is available during proof verification.
- The benchmark path needs deterministic timed blocks, so the bulk seeder submits one extrinsic at a time and waits for on-chain inclusion before issuing the next submission.
- The benchmark node avoids the instant-seal behavior that previously forced increasingly complex inclusion workarounds during large local seed runs.

The node is still required to run with archival pruning settings because the indexer's normal historical-state requirement remains in force even for the synthetic chain.

## Synthetic Seeding And Benchmark Flow

The synthetic benchmark path is organized around durable artifacts rather than ad hoc shell scripting.

### Seed manifest

`src/bin/seed_synthetic_runtime.rs` is the source of truth for the seeded workload.

- In `smoke` mode it submits a small set of hand-picked transactions that exercise several query shapes.
- In `bulk` mode it submits many `Synthetic::emit_burst` transactions, waiting for each one to be included before submitting the next, so the resulting seeded workload spans successive blocks.
- After submission and confirmed inclusion it emits a `SeedManifest` JSON document containing:
  - chain identity (`genesis_hash`)
  - seeded block range
  - transaction and synthetic event counts
  - a list of `QueryExpectation` values describing which WebSocket `GetEvents` lookups must succeed

That manifest is the contract between the seeder and downstream validation code. Tests and benchmarks do not hardcode their own expectations independently; they consume the manifest produced by the actual seeding pass.

### Benchmark harness

`src/bin/benchmark_synthetic_indexing.rs` consumes a `SeedManifest` and measures the real indexer.

Its flow is:

1. Read the seeder manifest JSON.
2. Render a temporary synthetic index config whose `genesis_hash` and node URL match the seeded local chain.
3. Start `acuity-index` as a child process against an empty database.
4. Poll `GetEvents` over the indexer's public WebSocket API until every manifest query passes.
5. Query `SizeOnDisk` and compute elapsed-time throughput metrics.
6. Emit a `BenchmarkReport` JSON document.

This means benchmark success is defined by observable API behavior, not only by internal logs or process completion. The benchmark verifies that the indexer has actually made the seeded data queryable.

## Synthetic Integration Testing

The repository now has an external node-backed integration suite in
`tests/synthetic_integration.rs`.

These tests are marked `#[ignore]` because they require heavyweight local tooling
(`polkadot-omni-node` and a release runtime build), but their role is
architectural rather than incidental: they are the full end-to-end validation
path for the synthetic stack.

The suite uses helpers from `tests/common/mod.rs` to orchestrate this pipeline:

1. Build the synthetic runtime in release mode.
2. Generate a local chain spec from the runtime WASM.
3. Start `polkadot-omni-node` on random local ports.
4. Render a matching synthetic index config for that node's genesis hash, with
   optional test-specific overrides such as `index_variant = true`.
5. Start `acuity-index` against a temporary database and test-specific runtime
   options.
6. Seed deterministic synthetic transactions.
7. Validate observable behavior through the public WebSocket API.

The current synthetic integration suite covers:

- smoke end-to-end indexing and manifest-backed `GetEvents` validation
- request/response flows for `Status`, `Variants`, `GetEvents`, and `SizeOnDisk`
- `GetEvents` ordering and `before` cursor pagination
- `GetEvents includeProofs` behavior in both unavailable and finalized-proof-available modes
- subscription lifecycle for `SubscribeStatus`, `UnsubscribeStatus`,
  `SubscribeEvents`, and `UnsubscribeEvents`
- pushed `status` and `eventNotification` messages
- config-sensitive behavior for `index_variant = true`
- request validation, subscription-limit handling, and idle timeout enforcement
- fatal startup refusal on chain genesis-hash mismatch
- process restart plus RPC outage/recovery behavior, including the documented
  split between local requests and RPC-backed `Variants` / `GetEvents`

Because this path validates the actual WebSocket interface, it catches
integration breakage across runtime metadata, config rendering, indexing,
persistence, connection lifecycle, and query handling in one place.

It is intentionally broad, but it is not exhaustive. Notably, the suite does
not yet exercise `subscriptionTerminated` backpressure handling or
pruning-misconfiguration failure end to end.

## Developer Orchestration

The `justfile` is now part of the architecture for the synthetic workflow, not only a convenience wrapper.

- `runtime-build` builds the in-repo synthetic runtime in release mode.
- `synthetic-node` materializes the local chain spec and starts the local omni-node instance with the required archival settings.
- `seed-smoke` and `seed-bulk` produce deterministic seeded workloads.
- `test-integration` runs the ignored end-to-end synthetic integration suite.
- `benchmark-indexing` starts a disposable timed synthetic node, bulk-seeds it, and benchmarks indexing against that workload.

These recipes are the supported developer entrypoints for the synthetic stack. The binaries and helper module are structured so that the same underlying flow can be used interactively from `just`, from tests, or from future CI automation without duplicating the workflow logic.

## Startup Sequence

The normal startup path lives in `src/main.rs`:

1. Parse CLI args.
2. Load the required `run <INDEX_SPEC>` index specification.
3. Validate the spec and resolve runtime options (CLI > `--options-config` > defaults).
4. Resolve the database path and open sled.
5. Verify or initialize the stored `genesis_hash` in the root database.
6. Create shared runtime state plus long-lived tasks:
    a. Spawn a bounded subscription dispatcher task that applies subscribe/unsubscribe messages to shared in-memory registries.
    b. Spawn `websockets_listen(...)` once for the process lifetime.
    c. If `--metrics-port` is configured, bind a separate HTTP listener that serves `/metrics`.
    d. Spawn an index-spec watcher task for the active `<INDEX_SPEC>` path.
7. Enter the reconnect/supervisor loop (see [RPC Reconnection And Spec Reload](#rpc-reconnection-and-spec-reload) below). On each iteration:
    a. Connect to the target node with `subxt` (retry with exponential backoff on transient failures).
    b. Verify the connected chain genesis hash matches the config.
    c. Publish the current RPC handle into shared runtime state.
    d. Publish whether the current run is in finalized mode into shared runtime state so WebSocket proof responses match the active indexing mode.
    e. Spawn `run_indexer(...)`.
    f. Wait for a termination signal, an accepted watched-spec update, or indexer completion, then act accordingly.

Startup error handling is centralized in a fallible `run()` path in `src/main.rs`. Configuration, database, and signal-registration failures return structured errors that are logged once before the process exits.

Important invariant:

- A database directory is tied to a single chain genesis hash. If the config or connected node disagrees with the stored hash, the process exits instead of mixing data from different chains.

## Data Model

The sled layout is opened in `Trees::open` in `src/shared.rs`.

- `root`
  Holds the sled database handle and root-level keys like `genesis_hash`.
- `span`
  Stores indexed block spans for resume/reindex logic.
- `variant`
  Stores event references keyed by `(pallet_index, variant_index, block_number, event_index)`,
  with `block_number` and `event_index` encoded as big-endian `u32` values.
- `index`
  Stores custom and built-in query keys under a compact binary prefix plus a
  `(block_number, event_index)` suffix encoded as big-endian `u32` values.

The two main query surfaces are:

- Variant queries via the `variant` tree.
- All other keys via the `index` tree.

`Key::Custom` covers every declared query key from `[keys]` in TOML. There is no separate built-in key model at config or index time.

## Indexing Flow

The main loop is `run_indexer` in `src/indexer.rs`.

### High-level behavior

- Determine the starting head block.
  - If `--finalized`, use the finalized head.
  - Otherwise use the best head.
- Load previously indexed spans from the `span` tree.
- Either resume an existing tail span or index the current head block immediately.
- Start two concurrent streams of work:
  - Backfill backward toward genesis.
  - Track new head blocks forward as they arrive.

This is why the README describes the indexer as indexing backward while simultaneously tailing the head.

### Per-block indexing

`Indexer::index_block(block_number)` does the block-level work:

1. Fetch the block hash from RPC.
2. Create a block-scoped `subxt` view with `api.at_block(hash)`.
3. Fetch and iterate decoded runtime events.
4. For each event:
    - Read pallet name, event name, pallet index, and variant index.
    - Optionally write a variant index record if `index_variant` is enabled.
    - Decode fields schema-lessly into `scale_value::Composite<()>`.
    - Derive indexing keys.
    - Write event references for each derived key.

Operational detail:

- Runtime decoding of persisted sled keys/values is now defensive. Malformed span records or malformed index keys are skipped with error logging rather than panicking the process.

### Event hydration and proof responses

`GetEvents` always reads event refs from sled first, then hydrates decoded event
payloads from the node for the returned refs.

When the request sets `includeProofs = true`, `src/websockets.rs` also asks
`src/event_hydration.rs` for one finalized proof per returned block. Each proof is
derived from the block header plus a `state_get_read_proof` call for the
`System.Events` storage item. The response surface intentionally distinguishes
between proofs not requested, proofs requested but unavailable, and proofs
successfully included.

### Key derivation

`Indexer::keys_for_event(...)` resolves keys only from the explicit TOML config returned by `IndexSpec::build_event_index()`. If no event mapping exists, the event is ignored unless variant indexing causes it to be stored/queryable by variant.

### Historical state requirement

`Indexer::index_block` requires historical state to be available for `api.at_block(hash)`. If the connected node has pruned historical state, the indexer exits with `StatePruningMisconfigured` and instructs the operator to run the node with `--state-pruning archive-canonical`.

## Concurrency Model

The indexer has one async loop that multiplexes several inputs with `tokio::select!`:

- exit notifications
- new chain head notifications from `subxt`
- queued live-head indexing futures
- queued backfill indexing futures
- periodic stats logging

Subscription control messages are handled by a separate long-lived dispatcher task in `src/main.rs`, which updates shared subscriber registries that outlive individual indexer reconnects.

Two separate queues exist inside the loop:

- Backfill queue for descending historical blocks.
- Live-head queue for ascending new blocks.

`queue_depth` applies to both. The code intentionally allows multiple outstanding block indexing futures so the process can catch up faster when the node is moving ahead.

Because futures can complete out of order, the code uses orphan maps:

- `orphans` for backward backfill continuity
- `head_orphans` for forward live-head continuity

Blocks only extend the active span once continuity is satisfied.

## Catchup With a Rapidly Syncing Node

The indexer does not poll for "am I behind?". Instead the node pushes new block numbers over the WebSocket subscription and the indexer reacts immediately.

### Live-head gap filling

When a new head block is received (`src/indexer.rs:996-1022`), `latest_seen_head` is updated to `max(latest_seen_head, announced_block)`. Then `queue_head_blocks` (`src/indexer.rs:723-738`) fills the live-head queue:

```rust
while head_futures.len() < queue_depth && *next_head_to_queue <= latest_seen_head {
    // queue index_block(next_head_to_queue)
    *next_head_to_queue += 1;
}
```

If the node jumps ahead by N blocks (e.g. during warp sync or a burst of finalization), all N blocks are queued immediately, up to `queue_depth` concurrently. The queue is refilled each time a future completes, so the pipeline stays saturated until the gap is closed.

### Out-of-order completion

Concurrent futures may complete out of order. Two orphan maps hold results that arrived early:

- `head_orphans` (`src/indexer.rs:958`) — for live-head results. `process_queued_head_result` (`src/indexer.rs:797-844`) advances `current_span.end` only once the contiguous chain from the previous high-water mark is assembled.
- `orphans` (`src/indexer.rs:969`) — for backfill results. `advance_backfill_start` (`src/indexer.rs:767-795`) enforces the same contiguity invariant in the descending direction.

Blocks park in the orphan map until their predecessor is confirmed, then the map is drained contiguously.

### Concurrent backfill

While the live-head queue is catching up, the backfill queue descends from the starting head toward genesis at the same time, also running up to `queue_depth` concurrent futures. Already-indexed ranges are skipped by `check_next_batch_block` (`src/indexer.rs:640-651`). When the descending backfill reaches a previously indexed span, `check_span` (`src/indexer.rs:608-634`) merges them.

### Primary tuning lever

`--queue-depth` (default `1`, overridable via CLI or `--options-config`) controls how many concurrent block-indexing RPC calls are issued for both queues. Increasing it is the main way to speed up catchup against a node that is moving quickly.

## Span And Resume Semantics

Resume behavior is implemented by the span helpers in `src/indexer.rs`.

Each stored span means: blocks `start..=end` have been indexed for a specific
index-spec revision.

Span values persist only the config version boundary info derived from
`IndexSpec.spec_change_blocks`.

When loading spans, the indexer may discard or trim them if they are stale relative to the current run:

- If `spec.spec_change_blocks` indicates the index spec changed starting at some block, affected spans are removed or split so that only the stale portion is reindexed.

Changes to `index_variant` only trigger historical reindexing if
the spec revision is advanced via `spec_change_blocks`.

Important invariants:

- The active in-memory `current_span` is not always persisted immediately. On shutdown or recoverable error, `save_current_span(...)` persists the current progress back into the `span` tree before the indexer task returns.
- If the upstream `subxt` block stream closes because the node disconnects or exits, the indexer saves the current span and returns `BlockStreamClosed` so the supervisor loop in `src/main.rs` can re-establish the connection and resume indexing.

## RPC Reconnection And Spec Reload

The indexer is wrapped in a supervisor loop in `src/main.rs` that handles transient RPC failures and accepted index-spec reloads without data loss.

### Error classification

`IndexError::is_recoverable()` (`src/shared.rs`) classifies each error variant:

- **Recoverable**: `Subxt`, `RpcError`, `BlocksError`, `BlockStreamClosed`, `EventsError`, `OnlineClientAtBlockError`, `OnlineClientError`, `BlockNotFound` — these indicate transient network or node issues and trigger reconnection.
- **Fatal**: `Sled`, `Tungstenite`, `Hex`, `StatePruningMisconfigured`, `CodecError`, `MetadataError`, `Json`, `Io`, `TomlSer`, `Internal` — these indicate configuration or data integrity problems and cause the process to exit.

### Supervisor behavior

On each iteration:

1. Check if SIGTERM was received between loops (via `term_now` atomic flag).
2. Read the latest accepted `ConfigSnapshot` and derive the effective RPC URL.
3. Attempt RPC connection via `connect_rpc()`. Transient failures log the error and sleep with exponential backoff before retrying. Fatal connection errors exit immediately.
4. While waiting to connect, also listen for watcher-published spec updates so the next connection attempt uses the newest accepted spec immediately.
5. Verify genesis hash. A mismatch is fatal (exits with an error).
6. Publish the fresh RPC handle into shared runtime state and spawn the indexer task.
7. `select!` on the signal handler, the spec update channel, the watcher task, and the indexer task handle.
8. On SIGTERM: clear the shared RPC handle, send the process exit signal, await the indexer, watcher, WebSocket, and metrics tasks, flush sled, and return `Ok(())`.
9. On accepted reloadable spec change: clear the shared RPC handle, signal only the current indexer to stop, let it persist the active span, and continue the loop immediately with the new spec.
10. On indexer completion:
   - `Ok(())` — clean shutdown (e.g. exit signal received), return `Ok(())`.
   - Recoverable error — clear the shared RPC handle, log the error, sleep with backoff, and `continue` the loop to reconnect.
   - Fatal error — log and return `Err`.
   - `JoinError` (panic) — log and return a fatal `Internal` error.

### Spec watcher behavior

`watch_index_spec(...)` watches the parent directory of the configured
`<INDEX_SPEC>` path and filters filesystem events back down to the target file.

Its behavior is:

- watch for in-place writes and replace-via-rename editor save patterns
- debounce short event bursts before re-reading the file
- parse and validate the entire updated spec before publishing it
- reject updates that change `name` or `genesis_hash`
- classify accepted updates as either `RestartIndexer` or `Unchanged`

The watcher never mutates the live indexer in place. It only publishes accepted
snapshots to the supervisor loop, which decides whether to restart the indexer.

### Backoff timing

- Initial delay: 1 second (`INITIAL_BACKOFF_SECS`)
- Maximum delay: 60 seconds (`MAX_BACKOFF_SECS`)
- The delay doubles after each consecutive failure and resets to 1 second on a successful connection.

During backoff sleeps, SIGTERM is checked via `signals.next()` so the process exits promptly rather than waiting for the full backoff duration.

### Span state preservation

Because `run_indexer` saves the current span before returning on any error path, the supervisor loop preserves all committed indexing progress. On reconnection or accepted spec reload, `load_spans` reconstructs the span state from sled, and any blocks not covered by a span are re-indexed. This makes the restart path idempotent.

## Index Spec Model

The TOML schema for `IndexSpec` is defined in `src/config.rs`.

Top-level fields:

- `name`
- `genesis_hash`
- `default_url`
- `index_variant`
- `spec_change_blocks`
- `keys`
- `pallets`

Runtime options (`url`, `db_path`, `db_mode`, `db_cache_capacity`, `queue_depth`,
`finalized`, `port`, `max_connections`, `max_total_subscriptions`,
`max_subscriptions_per_connection`, `subscription_buffer_size`,
`subscription_control_buffer_size`, `idle_timeout_secs`, `max_events_limit`)
are loaded from a separate `OptionsConfig` TOML file via the
`--options-config` CLI flag. At startup, `resolve_args()` merges those values with
**CLI flags > `--options-config` file > built-in defaults** precedence. `finalized`
uses OR logic: `cli_flag || options_flag.unwrap_or(false)`. `index_variant` comes
only from `IndexSpec`.

Pallet configuration uses one mode: explicit event mappings in TOML.

`ParamConfig::resolve(...)` turns TOML key names into runtime `ParamKey` values:

- `ParamKey::Scalar { name, kind }` for scalar keys declared in `[keys]`
- `ParamKey::Composite { name, fields }` for binary composite keys built from multiple event fields and declared in `[keys]`

Event params may use either `field = "..."` for scalar keys or
`fields = ["...", "..."]` for composite keys. Composite keys are encoded
as ordered binary tuples by the indexer and queried through the same `Key::Custom`
API surface.

Important invariant:

- Unknown TOML key names are rejected at config validation time, not lazily during indexing.

## Event Key Extraction

Schema-less field extraction helpers live in `src/indexer.rs` and are driven by
the explicit TOML mappings compiled by `IndexSpec::build_event_index()`.

The pattern is:

- Decode event fields into generic `scale_value::Value` trees.
- Extract common scalar shapes such as account IDs, u32/u64/u128 values, booleans, strings, byte arrays, or vectors.
- Emit `Key` values for the event according to the configured built-in or custom key mapping.

## Event Encoding

Decoded events are converted to JSON in `Indexer::encode_event(...)` and `composite_to_json(...)`.

The encoded payload includes:

- `specVersion`
- `palletName`
- `eventName`
- `palletIndex`
- `variantIndex`
- `eventIndex`
- `fields`

Notable encoding choices:

- `u128` and `i128` are serialized as strings to avoid JavaScript precision loss.
- Some byte-like unnamed composites are serialized as `0x...` hex strings.
- Variant values are represented as `{ "variant": ..., "fields": ... }`.

## WebSocket API Flow

The public API is implemented in `src/websockets.rs`.

### Request path

For each client connection:

1. Accept a TCP connection.
2. Attempt to upgrade it to WebSocket.
3. Read JSON requests into `RequestMessage`.
4. Either handle the request locally or forward subscription intent to the shared subscription dispatcher.

Important operational details:

- The listener enforces WebSocket frame and message size limits during handshake/runtime.
- If the global connection cap is exhausted, the upgrade is rejected with HTTP `503 Service Unavailable`.
- Each accepted connection is subject to an idle timeout and a per-connection subscription cap. Setting `idle_timeout_secs = 0` disables the timeout.
- There is also a global total subscription cap across all connections. When exceeded, new subscriptions are rejected with a request-scoped `subscription_limit` error. Because the subscription was never established, no `subscriptionTerminated` notification is sent for that initial rejection.

### Local reads

These are answered directly from sled or RPC in `process_msg(...)`:

- `Status`
- `Variants`
- `GetEvents { key }`
- `SizeOnDisk`

`GetEvents` reads matching event refs from sled, then hydrates `decodedEvents` from the node before responding.

Operational detail:

- `Status` and `SizeOnDisk` are local and continue working while the node RPC is unavailable.
- `Variants` and `GetEvents` require a live RPC handle. During reconnect backoff they return a request-scoped `temporarily_unavailable` error instead of disconnecting the client.

### Subscriptions

Subscription registration is split across tasks:

- WebSocket handlers send `SubscriptionMessage` values over an internal bounded channel and wait for the dispatcher to accept or reject the request before replying.
- A long-lived subscription dispatcher task owns updates to the actual subscriber registries.
- When a newly indexed event matches a subscribed key, the indexer pushes a `ResponseMessage::Events` update to those subscribers.
- Status subscribers are notified when the live head advances the persisted span.

Current WebSocket-side safeguards:

- subscribe/unsubscribe forwarding uses bounded backpressure rather than unbounded buffering
- per-connection subscriptions are capped (configurable: `--max-subscriptions-per-connection`)
- total subscriptions across all connections are capped (configurable: `--max-total-subscriptions`)
- invalid custom key payloads are rejected with request-scoped `invalid_request` responses before subscription registration or sled scans
- custom key names are limited to `128` bytes and string values to `1024` bytes
- composite values are limited to `64` elements, `8` nesting levels, and `16384` encoded bytes
- idle connections are disconnected automatically (configurable: `--idle-timeout-secs`)
- malformed persisted event/span index records are skipped during reads instead of crashing the server

All WebSocket operational parameters are configurable via CLI flags or `--options-config` TOML:

| Parameter | CLI flag | Default |
|---|---|---|
| max connections | `--max-connections` | 1024 |
| max total subscriptions | `--max-total-subscriptions` | 65536 |
| max subscriptions per connection | `--max-subscriptions-per-connection` | 128 |
| subscription buffer size | `--subscription-buffer-size` | 256 |
| subscription control buffer | `--subscription-control-buffer-size` | 1024 |
| idle timeout | `--idle-timeout-secs` | 300 |
| max events per query | `--max-events-limit` | 1000 |

Protocol-safety constants that remain compile-time:

- max WebSocket message size (`256 KiB`)
- max WebSocket frame size (`64 KiB`)
- max custom key name length (`128 bytes`)
- max custom string value length (`1024 bytes`)
- max composite depth (`8`) and elements (`64`)

Important invariant:

- The WebSocket server does not own indexing state. It performs read queries and forwards subscribe/unsubscribe requests to shared runtime state that survives indexer reconnects.

## Generated Chain Configs

`src/config_gen.rs` inspects metadata from a live chain and builds a starter TOML config.

It currently requires runtime metadata v14 or higher. The generator relies on
`subxt` to convert the raw `state_getMetadata` payload into the metadata model
used for pallet/event inspection, and that conversion path does not support the
legacy v13 payloads returned by older runtimes.

In practice this limitation usually appears when a node is still syncing early
chain history and its current best block is still running a pre-upgrade runtime.
The generator checks the raw metadata version first and returns a targeted error
that explains the likely sync/runtime-upgrade cause.

This is heuristic, not perfect. It tries to:

- detect account-like fields using name/type shape only
- infer scalar key types
- recognize collection fields that should use `multi = true`

Generated configs are intentionally structural. The generator may auto-declare
`account_id = "bytes32"` when a field name/type clearly looks like an account
identifier, but it does not infer semantic aliases from pallet or event context.
Chain-specific semantic names such as `ref_index` must be declared by the spec author.

## Key Files For Common Changes

- Add or change CLI/runtime startup behavior or reconnection logic, or change how config options are resolved and merged:
  `src/main.rs`
- Change how spans resume or reindex:
  `src/indexer.rs`
- Add a new declared key storage shape or scalar kind:
  `src/config.rs`, `src/shared.rs`, `src/indexer.rs`
- Change index-spec hot reload behavior or watcher integration:
  `src/main.rs`
- Change how operational/WebSocket parameters are resolved and merged, or add new CLI flags:
  `src/main.rs`, `src/config.rs`, `src/shared.rs` (for `WsConfig`)
- Change WebSocket request/response shapes or connection limits:
  `src/shared.rs`, `src/websockets.rs`
- Change index-spec generation heuristics:
  `src/config_gen.rs`

## Gotchas

- Do not assume decoded event payloads are available without node access. Event refs are stored locally, but decoded payloads for `GetEvents` and `eventNotification` are hydrated from the node on demand.
- Do not assume every decoded field is named. Some event fields are positional and TOML may reference them by stringified index like `"0"`.
- Do not assume block indexing completes in numeric order. Both backfill and head processing can finish out of order and are stitched together afterward.
- Do not bypass genesis-hash checks when reusing an existing database path.
- Do not add chain-specific logic to the main loop if it can live in TOML instead.
- `Key::Custom` is the main path for declared queryable keys.
- Recoverable RPC errors trigger reconnection, not process exit. If you need the process to stop on a specific error, classify it as fatal in `IndexError::is_recoverable()`.

## Mental Model

The simplest correct mental model is:

1. Chain config says which event fields matter.
2. The indexer walks blocks and turns matching event fields into binary index entries.
3. Spans record which block ranges are already trustworthy for the current indexing mode.
4. The supervisor loop in `src/main.rs` recreates RPC clients and the indexer task; transient RPC failures trigger reconnection, and accepted watched-spec updates trigger an indexer-only restart, preserving all span state through sled.
5. The WebSocket server is a thin query/subscription layer on top of sled plus shared subscriber lists that survive reconnects.

If you are changing behavior, first decide which layer owns it:

- config/schema concern
- field extraction concern
- per-event indexing concern
- span/resume concern
- reconnection concern
- API/query concern
