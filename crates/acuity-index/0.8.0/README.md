# acuity-index

A configurable, schema-less event indexer for Substrate-based blockchains.
It connects to a node via WebSocket, decodes on-chain events, stores them in
an embedded [sled](https://github.com/spacejam/sled) database, and exposes the
indexed data through a WebSocket API.

Primary documentation now lives in the in-repo mdBook at
[`book/`](./book/) and can be built locally with `just book-build` or served with
`just book-serve`.

Start there for mixed operator, contributor, and internals documentation:

- book entrypoint: [`book/src/index.md`](./book/src/index.md)
- table of contents: [`book/src/SUMMARY.md`](./book/src/SUMMARY.md)

Detailed source documents remain available too:

- implementation overview: [`ARCHITECTURE.md`](./ARCHITECTURE.md)
- WebSocket protocol reference: [`API.md`](./API.md)
- security review and deployment guidance: [`SECURITY.md`](./SECURITY.md)

## Documentation

- Read the book for the primary project documentation: operator workflows,
  contributor workflows, and internal architecture.
- Use `README.md` as the short project entrypoint.
- Use `API.md`, `ARCHITECTURE.md`, and `SECURITY.md` as detailed companion
  references while the book continues to absorb more of their content.

## Features

- **Config-driven** — indexing rules are defined in TOML files; no recompilation needed for new chains
- **Explicit pallet rules** — every indexed event mapping lives in TOML, including SDK pallets
- **Resume-safe** — tracks indexed block spans and resumes after restart
- **Index-spec hot reload** — watches the active index-spec path and restarts only the RPC/indexer loop on accepted spec changes
- **Safe shutdown** — persists progress and exits cleanly on termination signals or when the upstream node disconnects
- **Backward indexing** — indexes from the chain tip backwards while simultaneously tracking new blocks
- **WebSocket API** — query events by key, subscribe to live updates, and inspect chain metadata
- **Optional finalized proofs** — `GetEvents` can include verifiable `System.Events` storage proofs when the indexer runs in finalized mode
- **Concurrent block fetching** — configurable queue depth for parallel backfill and HEAD catch-up requests

Any Substrate chain can be supported by generating or writing an index specification TOML and passing it as `<INDEX_SPEC>`.

## Requirements

- Rust **stable** (see `rust-toolchain.toml`)
- A running Substrate node with WebSocket RPC enabled
- The node must be started with `--state-pruning archive-canonical`
- `polkadot-omni-node` if you want to use the in-repo synthetic runtime for local integration tests and benchmarks

## Installation

```bash
cargo install --path .
```

For Rust clients consuming the WebSocket API, see
[`acuity-index-api-rs` on crates.io](https://crates.io/crates/acuity-index-api-rs).

For fuller narrative documentation, examples, and workflow guides, build and open
the in-repo book:

```

## Usage

```bash
acuity-index <COMMAND>
```

### Commands

| Command | Description |
|---|---|
| `run <INDEX_SPEC> [OPTIONS]` | Run the indexer for an index specification |
| `purge-index <INDEX_SPEC> [OPTIONS]` | Delete the index database for an index spec |
| `generate-index-spec <INDEX_SPEC> --url <URL> [--force|-f]` | Inspect live metadata and write a starter index specification TOML file |

### Run Options

| Option | Default | Description |
|---|---|---|
| `--options-config <PATH>` | — | Path to a runtime options TOML file |
| `-d, --db-path <PATH>` | `~/.local/share/acuity-index/<spec-name>/db` | Database directory |
| `--db-mode <MODE>` | `low-space` | `low-space` or `high-throughput` |
| `--db-cache-capacity <SIZE>` | `1024.00 MiB` | Maximum sled page-cache size |
| `-u, --url <URL>` | index spec default | WebSocket URL of the Substrate node |
| `--queue-depth <N>` | `1` | Concurrent block requests during backfill and HEAD catch-up |
| `-f, --finalized` | `false` | Only index finalized blocks |
| `-p, --port <PORT>` | `8172` | WebSocket API port |
| `--metrics-port <PORT>` | — | Optional HTTP `/metrics` port for OpenMetrics scraping |
| `-v / -q` | — | Increase / decrease log verbosity |

`run` requires a positional `<INDEX_SPEC>` path before any options.

Runtime option precedence: **CLI flags > `--options-config` file > built-in defaults**.
`index_variant` is a top-level index spec field, not a runtime option.

When clients send `GetEvents` with `"includeProofs": true`, the response may also
carry `proofsByBlock` plus `proofsStatus` metadata. Proofs are only available
while the indexer is running with `--finalized` indexing; otherwise the response
returns `proofsByBlock: null` with an explanatory `proofsStatus`.

When `run <INDEX_SPEC>` points to a file, `acuity-index` watches that file for changes.
Accepted spec edits restart only the RPC/indexer loop; the WebSocket and metrics
servers stay up. Changes to `name` or `genesis_hash` are rejected and the current
spec keeps running.

### Examples

Use a custom index specification:

```bash
acuity-index run ./mychain.toml --url wss://mynode:443
```

Generate a starter index specification from a live node:

```bash
acuity-index generate-index-spec ./mychain.toml --url wss://mynode:443
```

Purge an existing index:

```bash
acuity-index purge-index ./mychain.toml
```

If the index-spec output file already exists, `generate-index-spec` fails unless `--force` or `-f` is supplied.

## Local Synthetic Devnet

This repository now includes a minimal in-repo Polkadot SDK runtime under `runtime/`, and a matching synthetic index spec renderer in `src/synthetic_devnet.rs`.

The synthetic runtime is intentionally small and deterministic:

- one custom `Synthetic` pallet emits searchable `u32`, `bytes32`, `account_id`, and multi-value event fields
- the local runtime now includes GRANDPA so finalized-head and proof-oriented flows can be exercised end to end
- `just synthetic-node` runs `polkadot-omni-node --instant-seal --pool-type single-state` for ad hoc local experimentation and smoke-style seeding
- `just benchmark-indexing` starts its own disposable synthetic node with `--dev-block-time 100 --pool-type single-state` and does not use `--instant-seal`

The ignored integration suite also includes proof-oriented coverage:

- default mode verifies that `includeProofs` reports proofs as unavailable when the indexer is not running with `--finalized`
- finalized-mode coverage starts a libp2p-enabled local node, runs the indexer with `--finalized`, requests proofs through `GetEvents`, and verifies the returned header plus storage proof against the block state root

Useful recipes:

```bash
# build the in-repo runtime, emit a chain spec, and run the synthetic dev node locally
just synthetic-node

# seed a small deterministic dataset for integration testing against the running node
just seed-smoke

# run the ignored node-backed integration suite
just test-integration

# auto-start a timed synthetic node, seed many event-dense blocks, and benchmark end-to-end indexing throughput
just benchmark-indexing
```

The benchmark recipe starts its own synthetic node on the selected RPC port. Its bulk seeder submits one transaction, waits until that transaction has been included in a block, and only then submits the next one. The reported event rate is based on the synthetic pallet events submitted by the seeder.

By default, `just benchmark-indexing` starts at `queue_depth=4`, seeds 5000 burst blocks with `burst_count=128`, waits up to 600 seconds for each benchmark run to become ready, prints the JSON report for each successful run, then prints a summary table and the first failing `queue_depth`.

The ignored synthetic integration suite exercises the real node-backed stack end
to end, including `Status`, `Variants`, `GetEvents`, `SizeOnDisk`, subscription
flows, live notifications, selected WebSocket limits/error behavior, and
restart/reconnect behavior.

`just` recipe overrides are positional here. `queue_depth` is the starting depth, and each successful run doubles it until a run fails. To change the benchmark inputs, use:

```bash
just benchmark-indexing <rpc_port> <queue_depth> <batch_start> <batches> <burst_count> <timeout_secs>
```

For example:

```bash
just benchmark-indexing 9944 8 1000 1000 128 600
```

`generate-index-spec` currently requires runtime metadata v14 or higher.
The generator uses `subxt` metadata decoding to inspect pallets and event fields,
and the current implementation only converts modern FRAME metadata layouts. Nodes
serving older metadata, such as v13 from early chain history before a runtime
upgrade, are rejected with an explicit error instead of a generic decode failure.

This most often happens when pointing at a node that is still syncing from an old
genesis/runtime snapshot. In that case, wait until the chain has synced past the
runtime upgrade that introduced v14+ metadata and try again.

## Syncing And Warp-Synced Nodes

`acuity-index` indexes backwards from the observed tip while also tracking new blocks at the head. When the node is syncing quickly, `--queue-depth` is used for both historical backfill and forward HEAD catch-up so the indexer can catch up instead of processing only one new head block at a time.

The indexer requires historical state to be available. If the node prunes historical state, indexing stops with an explicit error explaining that `--state-pruning` must be set to `archive-canonical`.

For `polkadot-omni-node`, a working example is:

```bash
polkadot-omni-node --chain target/dev-chain-spec.json --dev --dev-block-time 1000 --state-pruning archive-canonical
```

Without `--state-pruning archive-canonical`, the node may still serve recent heads, but `acuity-index` will fail once it needs historical state during backfill.

## Shutdown Behavior

`acuity-index` persists the active in-memory span before exit so it can resume safely on the next start.

Clean shutdown happens in two cases:

- the process receives a termination signal
- a fatal startup/runtime error forces the process to exit

If the upstream node closes the live block stream or the RPC connection drops, `acuity-index` saves the active span, keeps the WebSocket server running, and reconnects with exponential backoff instead of exiting. Local requests such as `Status` and `SizeOnDisk` keep working, while RPC-backed requests such as `Variants` and `GetEvents` return a temporary-unavailable error until the node comes back.

If the watched index spec changes, `acuity-index` validates the new file before
switching. Accepted changes stop the current indexer cleanly, persist the active
span, and immediately restart indexing with the new spec. Invalid edits, or edits
that change `name` or `genesis_hash`, are rejected without killing the process.

On actual shutdown, the process logs the shutdown reason, stops the WebSocket server, flushes sled, and exits cleanly instead of panicking.

Startup failures such as invalid cache-size configuration, genesis-hash mismatches, database open errors, RPC initialization failures, and signal-registration failures are also reported as structured errors and logged before the process exits.

## Index Specification

Each chain is described by an index specification TOML file passed as `<INDEX_SPEC>`.

If a runtime includes multiple instances of the same Substrate pallet under
different names, treat them as distinct pallets in the config. Each instance
has its own pallet name in metadata and its own independent storage, calls,
events, and errors, even when the runtime uses the same pallet code for both.
This only applies to instantiable pallets; a non-instantiable pallet cannot be
added to a runtime more than once. For example, a runtime may include
`pallet_collective` twice as `Council` and `TechnicalCommittee`; those should
be configured as two separate pallets because proposals, votes, and membership
are tracked independently for each instance.

```toml
name = "mychain"
genesis_hash = "abc123..."
default_url = "wss://my-node:443"
index_variant = false
spec_change_blocks = [0]

# All query keys must be declared once at schema level
[keys]
account_id = "bytes32"
item_id = "bytes32"
revision_id = "u32"
item_revision = { fields = ["bytes32", "u32"] }

# Explicit pallet mappings
[[pallets]]
name = "MyPallet"

[[pallets.events]]
name = "SomeEvent"

[[pallets.events.params]]
field = "who"       # field name, or "0" for positional
key = "account_id"  # declared scalar key

[[pallets.events.params]]
field = "item_id"
key = "item_id"     # declared query key name

[[pallets.events.params]]
fields = ["item_id", "revision_id"]
key = "item_revision" # binary composite query key
```

`spec_change_blocks` lists the block heights where a new index-spec revision starts.
It must start with `0` and be strictly increasing. When a new boundary is added in
the past, existing indexed spans are kept through the block before that boundary,
and the suffix starting at the earliest affected boundary is re-indexed.

If you change `index_variant` and want historical data re-indexed
under the new setting, add a new `spec_change_blocks` boundary.

Changes to `default_url`, explicit pallet mappings, declared keys,
`index_variant` or `spec_change_blocks` are applied by the
hot-reload path when the watched spec file is updated.

### Runtime Options Config

Runtime options can be loaded from a separate TOML file via `--options-config`.
This is useful for deployment-specific settings (like a WebSocket URL, database path,
or listener port) that vary across environments.
`index_variant` lives in the index spec, not in the runtime options file.

All fields are optional — omit any field to keep its built-in default:

| Field | Type | Default |
|---|---|---|
| `url` | string | index spec `default_url` |
| `db_path` | string | `~/.local/share/acuity-index/<chain>/db` |
| `db_mode` | string (`"low_space"` or `"high_throughput"`) | `low_space` |
| `db_cache_capacity` | string | `1024.00 MiB` |
| `queue_depth` | integer | `1` |
| `finalized` | boolean | `false` |
| `port` | integer | `8172` |
| `metrics_port` | integer | disabled |

Merge precedence: **CLI flags > `--options-config` file > built-in defaults**.
`finalized` is enabled if either the CLI flag or the options config field is `true`.

### Scalar Keys

Every scalar key must be declared in `[keys]` with one of these kinds:

| Kind | Stored/query value |
|---|---|
| `bytes32` | 32-byte hex value |
| `u32` | 32-bit unsigned integer |
| `u64` | 64-bit unsigned integer |
| `u128` | 128-bit unsigned integer |
| `string` | UTF-8 string |
| `bool` | boolean |

Example:

```toml
[keys]
para_id = "u32"
candidate_hash = "bytes32"

[[pallets.events.params]]
field = "para_id"
key = "para_id"

[[pallets.events.params]]
field = "candidate_hash"
key = "candidate_hash"
```

### Composite Keys

Composite keys let the indexer build one binary query key from multiple
event fields. They are defined in `[keys]` and referenced with
`fields = ["...", "..."]` in event params.

Example:

```toml
[keys]
account_id = "bytes32"
item_id = "bytes32"
revision_id = "u32"
item_revision = { fields = ["bytes32", "u32"] }

[[pallets]]
name = "ContentReactions"

[[pallets.events]]
name = "SetReactions"

[[pallets.events.params]]
fields = ["item_id", "revision_id"]
key = "item_revision"

[[pallets.events.params]]
field = "reactor"
key = "account_id"
```

Notes:

- Use `field = "..."` for declared scalar keys.
- Use `fields = [...]` only for declared composite keys.
- Composite key values are ordered and binary encoded, so field order matters.

Generated specs may auto-declare structurally inferred keys such as
`account_id = "bytes32"` when a field name/type clearly looks like an account
identifier. Semantic aliases derived from pallet or event context, such as
`ref_index`, are not inferred and must be declared explicitly by the spec author.

## WebSocket API

The complete WebSocket API reference now lives in [`API.md`](API.md).

The public WebSocket service also enforces connection and request limits. See
[`SECURITY.md`](./SECURITY.md) for the current security review, deployment
guidance, and operational limits.

If you are integrating from Rust, the published client crate is
[`acuity-index-api-rs`](https://crates.io/crates/acuity-index-api-rs).

It covers:

- request and response envelopes
- all request types
- notification types
- key formats
- composite key request shapes
- pagination semantics
- error responses
- backpressure and subscription termination behavior
