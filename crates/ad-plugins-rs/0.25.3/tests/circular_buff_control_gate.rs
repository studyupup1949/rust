//! R9-79 — NDCircBuffControl gates the whole plugin, not just the completion.
//!
//! C `NDPluginCircularBuff::processCallbacks` (NDPluginCircularBuff.cpp:121-203)
//! wraps its ENTIRE body in the acquisition gate:
//!
//! ```cpp
//! // Are we running?
//! if (scopeControl) {
//!     ... soft/calc trigger evaluation ...
//!     pArrayCpy = this->pNDArrayPool->copy(pArray, NULL, 1);
//!     ... pre-buffer add / flush / post count / doCallbacks ...
//!     if (currentPostCount >= postCount) { ... }   // completion, also inside
//! } else {
//!     // Currently do nothing
//! }
//! ```
//!
//! So while `NDCircBuffControl` is 0 an arriving frame is not triggered on, not
//! copied, not buffered, and does not advance the completion test — and Control
//! is 0 in three distinct situations: before the first `Control = 1` write (the
//! param's default), after a user stop (`writeInt32(Control, 0)`, :255-260), and
//! after the preset trigger count completes the last sequence (:197).
//!
//! The port had no Control state at all. `push()` recorded every frame it was
//! handed and inferred "not running" from the status string, which only covered
//! the completed case.
