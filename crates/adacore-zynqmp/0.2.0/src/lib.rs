//! Support for the AMD Zynq UltraScale+ MPSoC.
//!
//! # Usage
//!
//! The crate expects a file called `memory.x`, which defines the memory map for a specific board,
//! in the package root of your Cargo project. Here is a sample memory map for the ZCU102 board:
//!
//! ```text
//! MEMORY
//! {
//!   DDR (rwx) : ORIGIN = 0, LENGTH = 2048M
//!   OCM (rwx) : ORIGIN = 0xFFFC0000, LENGTH = 256K
//! }
//!
//! REGION_ALIAS("CODE", DDR)
//! REGION_ALIAS("DATA", DDR)
//! ```
//!
//! Cargo will generate a linker script called `link.x` when the `adacore_zynqmp` crate is built. You must
//! ensure that this linker script is used by adding the following flag to your
//! `.cargo/config.toml`:
//!
//! ```text
//! [target.aarch64-unknown-none]
//! rustflags = [
//!     "-C", "link-arg=-Tlink.x"
//! ]
//! ```
//!
//! Alternatively, this flag can be defined in a build script or the `RUSTFLAGS` environment
//! variable.
//!
//! The [`std`](#std) feature enables limited support for `std`. The `adacore_zynqmp` crate must be
//! referenced in a use import to ensure that the crate is linked into the binary:
//!
//! ```
//! use adacore_zynqmp as _;
//!
//! fn main() {
//!     println!("Hello, world!");
//! }
//! ```
//!
//! In a `no_std` project the entry point must be defined using the [`entry`] macro.
//!
//! ## Interrupt Handling
//!
//! You can define custom interrupt handling by implementing the following functions:
//!
//! ```
//! #[unsafe(no_mangle)]
//! extern "C" fn _sync_handler() {
//!     // ...
//! }
//!
//! #[unsafe(no_mangle)]
//! extern "C" fn _irq_handler() {
//!     // ...
//! }
//!
//! #[unsafe(no_mangle)]
//! extern "C" fn _fiq_handler() {
//!     // ...
//! }
//!
//! #[unsafe(no_mangle)]
//! extern "C" fn _serror_handler() {
//!     // ...
//! }
//! ```
//!
//! By default, an interrupt leads to a spin loop.
//!
//! ## Exit Handling
//!
//! By default, a soft reset will be performed if an exit point is reached. You can change this
//! behavior by defining a custom exit handler:
//!
//! ```
//! #[unsafe(no_mangle)]
//! extern "C" fn _exit_handler() {
//!     // ...
//! }
//! ```
//!
//! # Optional Features
//!
//! ## `std`
//!
//! Provides limited support for `std` based on [Newlib](https://www.sourceware.org/newlib/),
//! including support for `cargo test`:
//!
//! ```no_run
//! use adacore_zynqmp as _;
//!
//! #[cfg(test)]
//! mod tests {
//!     #[test]
//!     fn it_works() {
//!         assert_eq!(2 + 2, 4);
//!     }
//! }
//! ```
//!
//! ### Limitations
//!
//! Panics on this target call `abort()` rather than unwinding the stack, which
//! has two consequences:
//!
//! - `#[should_panic]` cannot confirm an expected panic: when a
//!   `#[should_panic]` test actually panics, the abort terminates the whole
//!   test binary and the harness never observes the panic. A `#[should_panic]`
//!   test that does *not* panic is still reported as a failure correctly,
//!   since the harness only needs to observe a normal return.
//! - An unexpected panic in any test aborts the entire test binary; results
//!   for subsequent tests are lost. On QEMU, `abort()` triggers a soft reset
//!   which QEMU may not handle, causing the process to hang until the runner
//!   kills it. Enable the [`semihosting`](#semihosting) feature to make QEMU
//!   exit cleanly instead.
//!
//! Requires GNAT Pro for Rust 26 or newer, since stable Rust does not ship
//! `std` support for `aarch64-unknown-none`. GNAT Pro for Rust 27 or newer is
//! needed for correct timing values: the newlib PAL timing implementation in 27
//! reports durations with microsecond precision, while earlier versions compile
//! but produce coarse or incorrect timing in `Instant`-based measurements such
//! as libtest's per-test durations.
//!
//! ## `semihosting`
//!
//! Enables clean QEMU termination via semihosting, which is useful for
//! `cargo test` where a hanging process would otherwise require a timeout to
//! recover from. Specifically:
//!
//! - [`_exit`](https://www.man7.org/linux/man-pages/man3/exit.3.html) terminates
//!   via a semihosting `SYS_EXIT` call rather than a soft reset.
//! - The default exception handler calls `_exit(-1)` rather than spinning, so
//!   that QEMU exits cleanly when a panicking test triggers an abort exception.
//!
//! Enable this feature when running under QEMU. Do not enable it for
//! production builds targeting real hardware, where semihosting is not
//! available.
//!
//! Implies the [`std`](#std) feature.
//!
//! # Minimum Supported Rust Version (MSRV)
//!
//! This crate is guaranteed to compile on stable Rust 1.85.0 and up. It might compile with older
//! versions but that may change in any new patch release.
