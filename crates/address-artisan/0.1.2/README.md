# Address Artisan

Address Artisan is a vanity Bitcoin P2PKH address generator based on [BIP32](https://github.com/bitcoin/bips/blob/master/bip-0032.mediawiki) xpub key derivation.

This software is inspired by [Senzu](https://github.com/kaiwolfram/senzu) and aims to be:

- 🔒 **Secure**: Generate vanity addresses even for hardware wallets! 🤯
- ⚡ **Fast**: Built in Rust with fast public key derivation and prefix matching. 🚀
- 😎 **Cool**: "1There1sNoSpoon" is much cooler than "bc1qtheresn0sp00n". P2PKH wins! 🎉

## Get the Tool

You can install the tool using:

```
cargo install address-artisan
```

Or clone the repository and build it:

```
cargo build --release
```

## Usage

The tool requires 2 mandatory arguments (`xpub` and `prefix`) and can take 1 optional argument (`max-depth`), and 1 optional flag (`i-am-boring`):

- `xpub`: Extended public key (obtainable from almost any Bitcoin wallet)
- `prefix`: Desired address prefix (must start with "1")
- `max-depth`: Maximum depth of the last derivation path. A larger max-depth means better utilization of the key space and cache. However, an address may get buried in a large gap, and since [account discovery](https://github.com/bitcoin/bips/blob/master/bip-0044.mediawiki#user-content-Account_discovery) is designed to be sequential, it may take time for the wallet to find it after increasing the gap limit. Testing suggests 100,000 is an optimal value, causing only a 3-second wallet freeze during setup.
- `i-am-boring`: For those who prefer more serious logging output (but be warned, the Artisan won't be pleased!)

For detailed information, use the help command:

```
address-artisan --help
```

For a complete walkthrough with all steps and details, check the [Example](#example) section.

## ⚠️ **WARNING**
Yes, it's completely safe to use this tool. But be aware of the following:
- Don't send funds to the vanity address without first confirming it appears in your addresses list.
- Store the derivation path and address index so you can always recover your funds. It's even possible to save them on the [Bitcoin Blockchain](https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/OP_RETURN).

Again, see the [Example](#example) section for a complete and safe walkthrough.

## BIP44 Compliance

While this tool is **not** (and cannot be) compliant with [BIP44](https://github.com/bitcoin/bips/blob/master/bip-0044.mediawiki), it can be used with BIP44-compliant wallets. Here's how it works:

BIP44 standardizes 5 levels of derivation:

```
m / purpose' / coin_type' / account' / change / address_index
```

Where:
- `m`: Master key
- `purpose'`: Constant 44' (0x8000002C) - following [BIP43](https://github.com/bitcoin/bips/blob/master/bip-0043.mediawiki)
- `coin_type'`: Coin identifier, following [SLIP44](https://github.com/satoshilabs/slips/blob/master/slip-0044.md). 0' (0x80000000) for Bitcoin
- `account'`: Account number for fund organization - greater than 0' (0x80000000)
- `change`: Boolean flag - 0 (0x00) for receive addresses, 1 (0x01) for change addresses
- `address_index`: Address index

This tool brute-forces a path of the form:

```
xpub_path' / random_number / <n derivation paths> / 0 / address_index
```

Where:
- `xpub_path'`: User-provided hardened derivation path
- `random_number`: Randomly generated number for unique key space per run - less than 0' (0x80000000)
- `<n derivation paths>`: One or more derivation paths for key space expansion - each less than 0' (0x80000000)
- `0`: Constant 0 (0x00) for BIP44-compliant wallet compatibility
- `address_index`: Address index within the account - less than *max_depth* CLI argument

By maintaining 0 as the second-to-last derivation path, BIP44-compliant wallets will recognize the vanity address as the *address_index*th receive address when using `xpub_path' / random_number / <n derivation paths>` as the wallet's input path.

## Example

The following example demonstrates the complete process of generating and using a vanity address with this tool. The [Sparrow](https://github.com/sparrowwallet/sparrow) wallet will be used for this demonstration. 


### Get the xpub

First, you'll need to set up a working wallet that supports the P2PKH script type.

If you already have a P2PKH wallet (which is unlikely since most modern wallets default to SegWit), it's recommended to create a new one with a custom derivation path. You won't need to generate a new seed phrase or reset your hardware wallet - using a different derivation path allows you to keep your existing wallet funds completely separate.

1. Create a new P2PKH wallet by selecting *P2PKH* as the script type.

![New wallet](./assets/new_p2pkh_wallet.png)

2. On the next screen, set up the derivation path. I purpose to use the following path:

```
m/1034543799'/0'/0'
```

This path uses:
- Purpose: 1034543799' (0xBDA9E2B7) for vanity addresses
- Coin type: 0' (0x80000000) for Bitcoin ([SLIP44](https://github.com/satoshilabs/slips/blob/master/slip-0044.md))
- Account: 0' (0x80000000)

Note: Make sure to include the ' after each number to ensure hardened derivation.

3. The next screen will display your xpub. In this example, it's:
`xpub6DK1UMgy8RpXQYaE6PmRfEMf2tkTzz8wBHreDSriH5bXQb2KE4f9MzEnAMMbpoQ4HcaUyMytM7d2cBLXvtEMJXgmofNCaRh8Ah5HzwiRHLD`

Copy this value for the next step.

### Generate the Vanity Address

Run the tool with your xpub and desired prefix:

```
address-artisan --xpub xpub6DK1UMgy8RpXQYaE6PmRfEMf2tkTzz8wBHreDSriH5bXQb2KE4f9MzEnAMMbpoQ4HcaUyMytM7d2cBLXvtEMJXgmofNCaRh8Ah5HzwiRHLD --prefix 1Test
```

The tool will output three pieces of information:

```
Address: 1TestbXeUg2HDciy2Va5gYyoN8SbL51jt
Derivation path: xpub'/335682406/36995
Receive address index: 436
```

Where:
- `xpub'` represents your initial derivation path (`m/1034543799'/0'/0'` if you followed the guide above)

The complete derivation path for this address is `m/1034543799'/0'/0'/335682406/36995/0/436`

### Import the Address in Your Wallet

1. Create a new P2PKH wallet using the same seed phrase or hardware wallet, but this time use the derivation path returned by the tool.

![Vanity wallet derivation path](./assets/vanity_wallet_derivation_path.png)

In this example, use: `m/1034543799'/0'/0'/335682406/36995`

2. Since software wallets uses a default gap of 20 addresses, you'll need to adjust this in the Advanced settings. Set the gap limit to a value higher than your address index.

### Verify the Address

1. In the Addresses tab, scroll down to your receive address index and verify that you see your vanity address.

![Confirm the address](./assets/vanity_wallet_confirm_the_address.png)

2. Once confirmed, the address is ready to receive funds securely. Double-click the address to open the default Receive screen.
