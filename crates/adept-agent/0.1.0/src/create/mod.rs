//! LLM-assisted skill generation (`adept create`) for Agent Skills.
//!
//! Mirrors [`crate::fix`]'s shape: everything that talks to a model goes
//! through a `&dyn crate::LlmClient`, and the single public entry
//! point, [`create_skill`], only *computes* a candidate — it never writes to
//! disk. Callers that want to apply the result pass [`CreateReport::files`]
//! to [`crate::writer::write_all_transactionally`].
//!
//! Unlike `fix`, `create` has no "before": there is no existing skill to
//! compare a candidate against, only a brief. The loop is generate → screen
//! → repair:
//!
//! 1. **Generate** one candidate skill from the brief (one LLM call).
//! 2. **Screen** it in memory: insert it into a [`adept::SkillSet`] alongside
//!    the siblings discovered at [`adept::sibling_root`], canonicalize with
//!    `adept_fmt`, and lint the whole set — so both [`adept::SkillRule`] and
//!    [`adept::SetRule`] findings are visible.
//! 3. **Repair**, for up to `max_rounds`: the gate is zero `Error`/`Warning`
//!    diagnostics on the candidate itself, *and* no diagnostic newly
//!    appearing on a sibling relative to a pre-generation baseline lint of
//!    the siblings alone (see [`crate::gate::passes_severity_gate`] and
//!    [`crate::gate::improves_on`], the same comparison machinery `fix`
//!    uses). A sibling's own pre-existing findings never block emission and
//!    are never rewritten — only the candidate is. If no round reaches the
//!    gate, the best-scoring candidate seen is carried forward rather than
//!    discarded; [`CreateOutcome`] tells the caller which happened.
//!
//! A second, independent LLM call then generates a synthetic eval dataset
//! (`evals/evals.jsonl`) for the accepted candidate, given both the
//! candidate and the original brief — validated against
//! `adept::evals::validate` before being returned; a dataset that fails
//! validation fails the whole run.
