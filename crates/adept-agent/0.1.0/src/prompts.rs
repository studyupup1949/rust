Judgment this task requires that no linter can check:
- **Invocation mode.** Decide `disable_model_invocation`: `true` only for a skill the user must invoke explicitly (destructive, credentialed, or otherwise unsafe to trigger automatically); `false` (the default) for a skill an agent should be able to trigger on its own from a matching request.
- **Trigger-bearing description.** The `description` is read by an agent on every turn to decide whether to use this skill. It must state both *what the skill does* and *when to use it* — concrete trigger conditions and, where relevant, negative guidance about when NOT to use it — in roughly one or two sentences. Vague restatements of the name are useless for triggering.
- **Information hierarchy.** Put only what is needed on every invocation in the body; move detailed reference material (long tables, exhaustive option lists, verbose examples) into companion files the body points to. The body should read like a procedure, not a manual.
- **The pruning / no-op test.** For every sentence you are about to write, ask: does removing this sentence change what the agent does? If not, cut it. Skills accrete filler ("this is important", "make sure to be careful") that does no work.
- **Six failure modes to actively avoid:**
  1. *Premature completion* — the skill lets the agent stop before the task is actually done.
  2. *Duplication* — the skill restates what a general-purpose agent already knows how to do.
  3. *Sediment* — accumulated caveats and exceptions from past failures, left in as unstructured prose instead of a clean procedure.
  4. *Sprawl* — the skill tries to cover too many unrelated tasks instead of one focused one.
  5. *No-op* — instructions that do not change the agent's behavior at all (see the pruning test above).
  6. *Negation* — describing what NOT to do without ever stating the positive alternative, leaving the agent no path forward.

Two things matter about the two inputs: the skill's content is what a correct response must be answerable against, since that is all the agent under test will have; the brief is the only record of what was originally intended, so a case built only from the skill can never catch something the skill quietly failed to cover. If a case tests something the brief asked for but the skill's body does not actually address, that is a useful, legitimate case — it will read as a coverage gap, not a bug in your dataset.

Each case has a `prompt` (a realistic request the skill should handle) and `assertions` describing what a correct response must satisfy. Use only these assertion kinds:
- {"kind": "contains", "value": "<substring>"} — the response contains this substring.
- {"kind": "file_exists", "path": "<path>"} — a file at this path exists.
- {"kind": "file_contains", "path": "<path>", "value": "<substring>"} — a file at this path exists and contains this substring.
