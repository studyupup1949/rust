//! LLM-assisted lint autofix (`adept fix`) for Agent Skills.
//!
//! Like `crate::eval`, the async seam is [`crate::LlmClient`]:
//! everything here that talks to a model goes through a `&dyn LlmClient`,
//! so callers can pass `crate::OpenAiCompatClient` for real fixing or
//! `crate::MockLlmClient` for fully offline tests. The single public
//! entry point, [`fix_skill`], is `async fn`; callers are expected to drive
//! it from a `tokio` runtime, same as `crate::eval_skill`.
//!
//! [`fix_skill`] only *computes* a candidate rewrite (a [`FixReport`] whose
//! [`FixReport::files`] are the pending writes, if accepted) — it never
//! writes to disk. Callers that want to apply the result pass those files to
//! [`crate::writer::write_all_transactionally`]. This keeps the whole fix loop
//! testable without touching the filesystem for anything but reading the
//! original skill's companion files, once, up front.
//!
//! Only [`adept::FixKind::Llm`] diagnostics from single-skill
//! ([`adept::SkillRule`]) checks are ever attempted: today that is `SL301`
//! (`description-tokens-over-budget`), `SL206` (`no-negative-guidance`) —
//! both tagged with [`adept::FixRegion::Description`] and so batched into
//! one description-scoped request — and `SL302` (`body-tokens-over-budget`),
//! tagged [`adept::FixRegion::Body`] and sent as a second, body-scoped
//! request. Which region a rule's diagnostics belong to is metadata on the
//! rule itself (`Rule::fix_kind`); this crate hard-codes no rule-code list.
//! Cross-skill (`SetRule`) findings are never rewritten.
