///
/// Matches **by directory name only** — no filename pattern, and explicitly
/// no content sniffing. `adept create` writes a synthetic eval dataset to
/// `evals/evals.jsonl`, and parsing candidate files during discovery would
/// put I/O and JSON parsing on the fast, offline `check` path, which must
/// stay fast. A dataset a user keeps somewhere else counts as ordinary skill
/// content, since adept did not put it there.
///
/// `path` is first made relative to `skill_dir` (falling back to `path`
/// itself if it is not actually under `skill_dir`), and only the *first*
/// component of that relative path is checked against `evals`. This is
/// deliberate: callers pass absolute paths, and matching on any ancestor
/// component (as an earlier version of this predicate did) would wrongly
/// exempt any skill that merely happens to live somewhere under a directory
/// named `evals` on disk (e.g. `/home/me/evals/my-skill/reference.md`), and
/// would also wrongly exempt arbitrarily deep nesting
/// (`sub/evals/x.jsonl`), neither of which is "top-level" per the spec.
///
/// Lives here beside [`is_license_file`] for the same reason: recognizing an
/// eval dataset is a companion-file naming concern; callers decide what to
/// do with the classification.
///
/// **Note on today's behavior:** [`discover_companion_files`] is
/// non-recursive, so a file under a nested `evals/` directory is never
/// discovered in the first place — this predicate can never fire against
/// current output of that function, and applying it is a no-op today. It is
/// kept as cheap defence-in-depth: if discovery ever becomes recursive (e.g.
/// to support `adept create`'s `evals/evals.jsonl`), the exemption is
/// already wired into its two applicable consumers (`SL303` in
/// `rules/tokens.rs`, and `adept_agent::eval`'s token-bloat view) rather than
/// needing to be added later, possibly incompletely, across every
/// consumer — including ones (like `adept_agent`'s fix conservation guard)
/// that must never see it change.
