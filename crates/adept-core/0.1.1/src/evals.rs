//! The eval-dataset schema: the published contract for `evals/evals.jsonl`.
//!
//! A forthcoming `adept create` command writes a synthetic eval dataset
//! alongside every skill it generates, so the skill's *behaviour* — not just
//! its lint-checked *form* — has something to be measured against. This
//! module defines that dataset's shape, parses and serializes it, and
//! validates it. **adept never executes a dataset.** Grading (running
//! `command` assertions, checking file contents, etc.) is the job of a
//! separate harness; this module's `validate` only checks that a dataset is
//! well-formed enough to hand to one.
//!
//! The on-disk format is JSONL: one [`EvalCase`] per line, with **no
//! enclosing envelope** (no top-level array, no wrapper object). This is
//! deliberate — it lets a dataset be streamed, appended to, and diffed one
//! case at a time. Because there is no envelope to carry document-level
//! metadata, every line repeats its own `schema_version`, which is what keeps
//! a file self-describing even after being truncated, concatenated with
//! another dataset, or appended to by hand.
//!
//! **adept never executes a dataset**: it never spawns a subprocess and
//! never runs a case itself. But adept is the reference *grader* for one,
//! invoked by a separate harness that executes each case and hands the
//! results back. The dataset half of this module (parsing, validating) has
//! no filesystem access beyond what a caller hands it as a `&str`; the
//! grading half ([`grade`]) does read files — but only ones the harness
//! names via a supplied working directory, never anything it spawns or
//! discovers on its own.
