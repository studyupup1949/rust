//! Shared cheap text-similarity primitives used by cross-skill heuristics.
//!
//! These are the tokenizer and Jaccard-similarity building blocks shared by
//! `adept`'s own `SL4xx` cross-skill rules (`rules::cross`) and by
//! `adept_agent`'s offline overlap shortlist (`adept_agent::eval::overlap`).
//! Extracted here so the two crates can't silently drift apart on what
//! counts as a "word" or how similarity is computed; each caller still
//! chooses its own *input text* and *similarity threshold* independently
//! (see each caller's docs for why).
