# adf

Lightweight Rust parsing and writing for Auto-lead Data Format (ADF) 1.0 XML leads.

This crate is aimed at low-overhead ADF processing:

- parses XML with `quick-xml`
- borrows input text where possible through `Cow<'a, str>`
- exposes a typed ADF model for common lead fields
- keeps unknown XML elements and attributes — on containers and compact elements alike — instead of discarding partner data
- preserves CDATA wrappers and unknown text entity references through the typed writer
- can write the original document byte-for-byte when it has not been changed
- can rewrite only dirty prospect spans for localized edits
- keeps ADF-specific validation separate from XML parsing, with optional strict mode plus DTD enum and lightweight ISO-like format checks
- never resolves external entities or expands custom ones, and bounds (or rejects) `<!DOCTYPE>` declarations to keep untrusted input safe

## Installation

```toml
[dependencies]
adf = "0.5"
```

## Example

```rust
use adf::parse;
use std::borrow::Cow;

fn main() -> Result<(), adf::Error> {
    let input = r#"<adf>
      <prospect status="new">
        <requestdate>2026-05-17T12:00:00-04:00</requestdate>
        <vehicle><year>2024</year><make>Toyota</make><model>Camry</model></vehicle>
        <customer><contact><name part="full">Jane Doe</name><email>jane@example.com</email></contact></customer>
        <vendor><vendorname>Example Dealer</vendorname></vendor>
      </prospect>
    </adf>"#;

    let mut doc = parse(input)?;

    let prospect = &doc.adf().prospects[0];
    assert_eq!(prospect.status.as_deref(), Some("new"));

    doc.prospect_mut(0)
        .unwrap()
        .status = Some(Cow::Borrowed("resend"));

    let output = doc.to_original_preserving_string()?;
    assert!(output.contains(r#"<prospect status="resend">"#));

    Ok(())
}
```

## Writing Modes

`AdfDocument::to_original_preserving_string()` preserves the original XML when the document is clean. If a single prospect is modified through `prospect_mut`, only that prospect's original byte span is rewritten and the surrounding XML is copied through unchanged.

`AdfDocument::to_typed_string()` writes normalized ADF XML from the typed model. This is useful when broad structural edits are made through `adf_mut`, or when normalized output is preferred over preserving original formatting. Non-element extension nodes such as comments, processing instructions, CDATA, and custom entity references are preserved, but only element extensions carry source spans for relative ordering around typed children.

`AdfDocument::root()` exposes the raw XML tree for callers that need it. The tree is parsed lazily on first access so typed-only processing does not retain both the full raw tree and the typed ADF model.

## Parsing Safety

The parser never resolves external entities and never expands custom (DTD-defined) entities: only the five predefined XML entities and legal numeric character references are substituted. Unknown references in text are preserved as entity-reference parts. Unknown references in attributes are kept as literal `&name;` text; normalized typed output escapes those ampersands because attributes are modeled as flat strings. This makes classic XXE and entity-expansion ("billion laughs") attacks structurally impossible.

`parse` keeps `<!DOCTYPE>` declarations so partner documents round-trip, but caps the declaration payload at `DEFAULT_MAX_DOCTYPE_LEN` (4096 bytes) by default. Use `parse_with` and `ParseOptions` to tighten or relax this:

```rust
use adf::{parse_with, ParseOptions};

fn main() -> Result<(), adf::Error> {
    // Reject any document carrying a DOCTYPE.
    let strict = ParseOptions::default().reject_doctype(true);
    assert!(parse_with("<!DOCTYPE adf>\n<adf/>", &strict).is_err());

    // Or just adjust the size cap (use `without_doctype_limit()` to disable).
    let relaxed = ParseOptions::default().max_doctype_len(16 * 1024);
    parse_with("<adf><prospect /></adf>", &relaxed)?;

    Ok(())
}
```

## Validation

Parsing requires well-formed XML rooted at `<adf>`. ADF-specific content checks are available through `AdfDocument::validate()`:

```rust
fn main() -> Result<(), adf::Error> {
    let report = adf::parse("<adf><prospect /></adf>")?.validate();

    for issue in report.issues {
        eprintln!("{:?}: {}: {}", issue.severity, issue.path, issue.message);
    }

    Ok(())
}
```

The default validator reports DTD-required elements as warnings, checks DTD enumerated attribute values (`prospect@status`, `vehicle@interest`, `price@type`, etc.), and warns on unsupported ISO 8601 datetime shapes plus malformed ISO 4217/ISO 3166 code shapes. It does not attempt full registry validation for every currency or country code.

`AdfDocument::validate_strict()` (or `validate_with(adf, ValidationOptions::default().strict(true))`) promotes the "missing required element" warnings to errors, suitable for gating on this crate's structural checks. Enum and date/country/currency shape issues remain warnings in strict mode.

## Logging and Tracing

`adf` emits passive `tracing` spans and events for parse, validation, and write operations. The crate does not install a subscriber; applications decide whether and how to collect those events.

Trace fields are limited to structural metadata such as byte counts, parse options, model counts, dirty flags, validation issue counts, and error categories/positions. They intentionally do not include raw XML, element text, attribute values, validation messages, names, emails, phone numbers, addresses, identifiers, URLs, comments, or extension payloads.

The public model and `AdfDocument::original()` still expose lead payloads; avoid logging those values directly when handling sensitive data.
