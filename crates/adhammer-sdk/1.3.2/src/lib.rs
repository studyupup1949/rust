//! # ADHammer Core — the SDK
//!
//! ADHammer is split into **Core** (this SDK — reusable libraries) and the **CLI** (the
//! `adhammer` binary that drives them). This crate is the single import surface for Core: it
//! re-exports every subsystem so a downstream tool can `use adhammer_sdk::{graph, kerberos, …}`
//! instead of depending on each `adhammer-*` crate individually.
//!
//! The subsystems, bottom-up:
//! - [`types`] — core types (`Sid`, `Guid`, `Snapshot`, `Finding`).  *(the `adhammer-core` crate)*
//! - [`collector`] — LDAP collection into a `Snapshot` (TLS backend via crate features).
//! - [`checks`] — the PingCastle-class audit rules.
//! - [`graph`] — the control-path graph and executable attack chains ([`graph::AttackPath`]).
//! - [`kerberos`] — AS-REP/Kerberoast, S4U/RBCD, PKINIT, ticket forging.
//! - [`ldap`] — the raw LDAP client (NTLM/SASL) used for writes and relay.
//! - [`sysvol`] — GPP cpassword + GptTmpl.inf analysis.
//! - [`bloodhound`] — SharpHound-compatible BloodHound CE export.
//! - [`secrets`] — offline SAM/LSA/DCC2 secret decryption.
//! - [`report`] — JSON/HTML reporting.
//!
//! For the DCE/RPC, NDR, PAC, DRSUAPI, GPO, and DPAPI layers, see the standalone crates
//! `dcerpc`, `ms-ndr`, `ms-pac`, `ms-drsr`, `gpo`, and `dpapi-offline`.

// `adhammer-core` is aliased to `types` so it never shadows the `core` extern-prelude crate.
