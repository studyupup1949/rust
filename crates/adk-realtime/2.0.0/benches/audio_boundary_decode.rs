//! Decode boundary benchmark: owned PCM16 decode vs borrowed (zero-copy) decode.
//!
//! The payload is one realtime frame: 20 ms of 24 kHz mono PCM16 =
//! 480 samples = 960 bytes. That is the unit a provider transport actually
//! hands to the codec, so per-iteration numbers map directly onto per-frame cost.
//!
//! This binary measures **latency only**, with Criterion. Criterion batches
//! iterations and amortizes the timer, so the measurement is not floored by
//! `Instant::now()` overhead (~20-25 ns), which would swamp a sub-100 ns
//! operation.
//!
//! Allocation counting deliberately lives in
//! `tests/audio_allocation_tests.rs`, not here. It needs an instrumented
//! `#[global_allocator]`, which taxes every allocation with an atomic counter
//! update — and only the owned arm allocates, so keeping it in this binary
//! would penalize that arm alone and inflate the reported speedup.
//!
//! Both latency arms consume the decoded samples identically (a checksum fold
//! behind `black_box`). Without that, the borrowed arm has no observable effect
//! and LLVM is free to delete it, which would report a fictional speedup.
