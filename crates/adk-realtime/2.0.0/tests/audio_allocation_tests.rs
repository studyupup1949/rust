//! Allocation accounting for the PCM16 decode boundary: owned decode vs
//! borrowed (zero-copy) decode.
//!
//! This lives in its own integration test rather than in
//! `benches/audio_boundary_decode.rs` on purpose. Counting allocations requires
//! installing an instrumented `#[global_allocator]`, and every allocation in
//! that binary then pays for an atomic counter update. Only the owned arm
//! allocates, so sharing a binary with the Criterion latency arms would tax the
//! owned arm alone and inflate the reported speedup. A separate test binary
//! keeps the instrumented allocator away from the timings.
//!
//! The payload is one realtime frame: 20 ms of 24 kHz mono PCM16 =
//! 480 samples = 960 bytes. That is the unit a provider transport actually
//! hands to the codec, so per-iteration numbers map directly onto per-frame
//! cost.
//!
//! Both arms consume the decoded samples identically (a checksum fold behind
//! `black_box`). Without that, the borrowed arm has no observable effect and
//! LLVM is free to delete it, which would report a fictional result.
