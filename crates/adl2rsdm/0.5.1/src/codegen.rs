//! Emit RsDM Rust source from a parsed [`MedmScreen`].
//!
//! This is the analogue of `adl2pydm/output_handler.py`: it walks the widget
//! tree and writes the target display. Where `output_handler` writes PyDM `.ui`
//! XML, this writes a Rust module — a `Screen` struct holding the widgets + an
//! [`Engine`], a `new(cc: &eframe::CreationContext)` builder, and a
//! `ui(&mut self, ui)` draw method that places each widget at its MEDM geometry.
//!
//! Placement is absolute (MEDM screens are absolute `x/y/w/h`) via a small
//! `place` helper that draws each widget in its own `egui::Area` at a fixed
//! position. The Area's `egui::Order` encodes the z-layer, so the user's rule —
//! decoration to the back, controls never occluded or click-stolen — holds by
//! construction: decoration Areas (`Background`) render and receive input below
//! monitors (`Middle`) below controls (`Foreground`). The emitter additionally
//! lays the `place` calls out back-to-front (a stable sort by [`ZLayer`]) so the
//! ordering is also visible in the source.
//!
