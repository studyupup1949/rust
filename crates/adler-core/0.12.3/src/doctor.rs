//! Site signature health check.
//!
//! Each [`Site`] declares which detection signals it relies on. Sites in the
//! wild change layouts, redirect to login walls, or start serving 200 for
//! deleted users — and detection rules silently rot. The doctor catches
//! that rot by exercising both polarities for every site:
//!
//! 1. If `known_present` is set, probe each of its candidate
//!    usernames in order; the present-check passes when **any one**
//!    of them resolves to `Found`. Listing more than one is defensive
//!    against sites that special-case specific accounts (e.g.
//!    Instagram's own `instagram` brand account returns a degenerate
//!    JSON shape).
//! 2. Probe with a random nonsense username and expect not-`Found`.
//!    (We don't require `NotFound` strictly: under-specified sites can
//!    legitimately return `Uncertain` for a nonexistent user. Only a
//!    `Found` here is wrong, because it means the rule generalises to
//!    arbitrary strings.)
//!
//! A site fails the check if either assertion is violated.
//!
//! [`suggest_fix`] goes one step further: for a failing site it diffs the
//! responses for the known-present user and a nonsense user and derives a
//! candidate signal set. It only *suggests* — applying changes to the
//! generated registry is the importer's job (see `scripts/import_sherlock.py`
//! `OVERRIDES`), and an auto-applied bad signature would be worse than a
//! flagged one.
