//! Browser backend for pages that are unusable from raw HTTP.
//!
//! A handful of sites (`bot-protected` tag — Instagram, X/Twitter, `TikTok`,
//! Facebook, Threads, Snapchat, Weibo, …) refuse to render anything useful
//! to a plain `reqwest` call: they ship a JavaScript login wall, a
//! Cloudflare challenge, or a TLS-fingerprint check. From Adler's signal
//! perspective the response looks identical for an existing account and a
//! missing one, so the verdict is always `Uncertain`.
//!
//! This module adds a thin abstraction over a *real* browser that can
//! execute JS, accept cookies, present a residential / mobile IP, and
//! return the final post-JS DOM. The existing detection signals
//! (`status_found`, `body_*`, `redirect_absent`) then work on the rendered
//! page exactly as they do on a raw HTTP response.
//!
//! ## Backends
//!
//! - [`local::LocalBackend`] launches a headless Chrome/Chromium process
//!   via [`chromiumoxide`]. Free, runs on the user's machine, requires
//!   Chrome to be installed.
//! - [`browserbase::BrowserbaseBackend`] creates a remote session on
//!   <https://browserbase.com> and connects to it via the CDP WebSocket
//!   the service exposes. Pays per session-minute, no local setup, comes
//!   with a residential / mobile proxy pool out of the box.
//!
//! Both backends drive Chrome through the same chromiumoxide [`Browser`]
//! handle — only the transport (process vs. WebSocket) differs.
//!
//! [`Browser`]: chromiumoxide::Browser
