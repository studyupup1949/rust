// Asciidoctor's "Process AsciiDoc Using the CLI" overview, tracked from the CLI

// converting a file, and printing help (`--help`). This crate's `adoc` command
// supports the same three invocations, so each is driven by a test below. The
// parts with no `adoc` counterpart are non-normative here: the Ruby runtime
// banner `asciidoctor --version` prints (adoc is a native binary with no such
// banner), the option catalog reached through the man page, and the `manpage`
// and `syntax` help topics, which `adoc` does not provide.

== Version and runtime

To confirm that the CLI is available, execute the following command in your terminal application:

 $ asciidoctor --version

Alternately, you can shorten the `--version` CLI option flag to `-v`:

 $ asciidoctor -v

If this command completes successfully, information about Asciidoctor and the runtime environment will be printed to the standard output of your terminal:

 Runtime Environment ({ruby-description}) (lc:UTF-8 fs:UTF-8 in:UTF-8 ex:UTF-8)

The runtime environment information varies based on the version of Ruby you're using and the encoding settings of your operating system.

== Convert an AsciiDoc file

To invoke Asciidoctor from the CLI and convert an `.adoc` file, execute:

 $ asciidoctor <asciidoc-file>

This will use the built-in defaults for options and create a new file in the same directory as the input file, with the same base name, but with the `.html` extension.

The Asciidoctor CLI accepts numerous options that control the behavior of the processor, from setting additional attributes (`-a`) to where the output file is written (`-o`).
Most options have both a longhand (e.g., `--out-file`) and shorthand form (e.g., `-o`).
The shorthand form is used throughout this documentation.
Once you're familiar with the options, the shorthand form is preferred and most common since it requires a lot less typing.

xref:man1/asciidoctor.adoc#options[CLI Options] describes the available options and parameters for the Asciidoctor CLI.

"#

    // Hand `adoc` a `<name>.adoc` file with no `-o` and confirm it derives
    // `<name>.html` alongside it, writes a complete HTML5 document there, and
    // prints nothing.

The `--help` option provides self-describing documentation for the `asciidoctor` command, grouped by topic.
"#
    );

    verifies!(
        r#"
If you don't specify a topic, the `--help` option prints the usage statement for the `asciidoctor` command:

 $ asciidoctor --help

Alternately, you can shorten the `--help` CLI option flag to `-h`:

 $ asciidoctor -h

"#
    );

    // TODO (https://github.com/asciidoc-rs/asciidoc-html5/issues/31): Implement the `--help syntax` topic so `adoc` prints an AsciiDoc syntax crib sheet, then promote its lines below from non_normative! to verifies!.

        r#"
You can generate the full documentation (i.e., man page) for the `asciidoctor` command by passing the `manpage` topic to the `--help` option.
You can pipe that output to the `man` pager to view it:

 $ asciidoctor --help manpage | man -l -

You can also find the man page for the `asciidoctor` command rendered as HTML in this documentation, which you can view in a browser instead.
See xref:man1/asciidoctor.adoc[asciidoctor(1)].

You can print an AsciiDoc syntax crib sheet by passing the `syntax` topic to the `--help` option.

 $ asciidoctor --help syntax

The crib sheet itself is composed in AsciiDoc.
You can convert it to HTML by piping the output back into the `asciidoctor` command.

 $ asciidoctor --help syntax | asciidoctor -o syntax.html -

Navigate to the [.path]_syntax.html_ file in your browser to see what the examples in the crib sheet look like when converted to HTML.
