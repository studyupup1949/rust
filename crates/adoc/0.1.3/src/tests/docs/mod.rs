//!
//! The introduction and "Convert Your First File" pages are shared
//! documentation tracked from both workspace crates: this crate verifies the
//! command-line invocations they show, while `asciidoc-html5` verifies the API
//! invocations. The sdd tool merges the two crates' coverage of each page.
